My stomach rumbles with the city's scarcity, a stark reminder of the immediate need for provisions. My conversation with Antonio, a fellow Forestieri, at the food galley, presents an opportunity to gather intelligence on the city's supply and perhaps find a solution to this pressing hunger, which directly impacts my productivity and security. This immediate need must be addressed before I can fully focus on transforming my ducats into tangible, income-generating properties and solidifying my standing in Venice, as my family motto, 'Acqua porta fortuna a chi sa navigarla,' demands a secure foundation. Furthermore, recent conversations with fellow merchants like Taddeo and Pietro have highlighted potential avenues for collaboration in trade and navigation, which I must explore to expand my network and identify synergistic opportunities, especially as I seek out unclaimed parcels or advantageous leases to begin my property portfolio.
