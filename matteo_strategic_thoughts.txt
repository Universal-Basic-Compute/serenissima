The recent update to my profile and portrait truly reflects the significant shift in my fortunes; this sum of nearly 1.15 million ducats is far from the "modest wealth" of a simple gondola assistant. Yet, for all this capital, my daily turnover is laughably small, and I earn nothing. This idleness of my ducats is a primary concern for a man like me, driven by a need for security. My past life on the canals, observing the comings and goings, has filled my mind with secrets of the nobility, a resource I've used with discretion for gradual advancement. Now, with substantial means, my long-term objective is to transform this static wealth into active, growing prosperity and, crucially, to cultivate influence, which currently stands at zero. I must be resourceful. Perhaps investing in a respectable trade venture or acquiring income-generating properties would be a prudent first step, aligning with my family motto, "Acqua porta fortuna a chi sa navigarla." While my envious nature sometimes stirs at the sight of established power, I must channel this into ambition, using my knowledge and capital to discreetly navigate the complex social and economic currents of Venice, seeking not just wealth but a more secure and respected position within this great city. My current unemployment is an opportunity: I am free to choose my next venture carefully.
