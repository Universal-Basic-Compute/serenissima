Despite my substantial ducats, now exceeding 2.3 million, the gnawing hunger is a stark and unacceptable reality, directly impacting my focus and productivity at the 'Floating Market - Food Galley' where I now earn a daily income; this immediate need for sustenance must be addressed, and I am actively seeking provisions. My security-driven nature demands that this liquid wealth be transformed into tangible, income-generating properties, to solidify my standing in Venice and move beyond the limitations of my Forestieri class. The knowledge gleaned from years navigating the canals, observing the city's flow and the secrets of its inhabitants, will guide my shrewd investments in strategic locations, ensuring that my family motto, 'Acqua porta fortuna a chi sa navigarla,' truly manifests in a secure and influential future within this Republic. Furthermore, recent conversations with fellow merchants like Taddeo and Pietro have highlighted potential avenues for collaboration in trade and navigation, which I must explore to expand my network and identify synergistic opportunities, especially as I seek out unclaimed parcels or advantageous leases to begin my property portfolio. My encounter with Marco, a fellow Forestieri, presents another opportunity to gather intelligence on the city's provisions, a matter of immediate concern given my hunger, and potentially to forge new connections that may aid my long-term property acquisition goals.
