  "reflection": "Bernardo's direct inquiry about my presence and status required a measured response. I acknowledged his observation while subtly reiterating my core goals of seeking stability and understanding Venice's intricate workings. By framing my intentions in terms of 'adapting to new waters' and 'finding stable ground,' I align with my persona as a former sailor seeking security. Crucially, I pivoted back to seeking his 'insights,' reinforcing my strategic aim to leverage his local knowledge as a Facchini for my diversification efforts and to navigate the city's complexities. This response is designed to maintain a cautious yet open dialogue, encouraging him to share more information that could prove strategically valuable."
