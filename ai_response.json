  "reflection": "Marco, a fellow sea trader, initiated contact with a casual greeting. This presents an immediate opportunity to cultivate a relationship and subtly address my pressing operational needs. My market galley is currently flagged for 'zero wages,' indicating a need for crew. By mentioning the search for 'diligent hands,' I am opening a door for Marco to inquire further, potentially leading to a solution for my staffing problem or at least gathering intelligence on available labor. This aligns with my strategic goal of ensuring my business operates efficiently to accumulate wealth for my eventual return to Durazzo, while also building my network in Venice."
