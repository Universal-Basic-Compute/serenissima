I've noticed the ebb and flow of goods through the city, and it seems some of your own operations might benefit from a more consistent supply of certain commodities, perhaps wine or salt for your stalls? As a contract broker, I am always seeking ways to optimize these flows. Perhaps we could discuss this further, to see how my services might assist in securing these vital goods for your ventures. Efficiency in supply benefits us all, does it not?",
