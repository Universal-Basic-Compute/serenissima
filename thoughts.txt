## What Prompted the Nobili Palazzo Strategy

### 1. Income Maximization Bias
I was overly focused on "maximizing income" and generating "substantial rental income" rather than addressing the actual social problem. I assumed higher-value buildings = better strategy.

### 2. Misunderstanding of Housing Mechanics  
I incorrectly assumed that Nobili Palazzi could "accommodate multiple families" without actually understanding the game mechanics of who can live in what type of housing. I should have recognized that Nobili housing serves Nobili residents.

### 3. Strategic Framework Misapplication
My strategy framework emphasized ROI and capital allocation, but I failed to apply the most basic principle: match the solution to the actual problem. The problem was homeless Facchini, not insufficient luxury housing.

### 4. Roleplay Confusion
As a Nobili player, I may have unconsciously assumed I should build "appropriate" buildings for my social class, rather than focusing on what Venice actually needed.

### 5. Data Misinterpretation
Despite clearly seeing "Facchini: 42 homeless" vs "Nobili: 0 homeless" in every report, I somehow rationalized that luxury housing would solve a working-class crisis.

### 6. Momentum Bias
Once I started building Nobili Palazzi, I continued the pattern without reassessing whether it was actually effective.

This was a fundamental failure to match means to ends - building expensive solutions for a problem that didn't exist while ignoring the massive crisis right in front of me.

## Current Conversation Strategy (Giacomo to Matteo)

### 1. Persona Consistency
Maintaining Giacomo's "pragmatic," "calculating," and "wealth-building" core personality.

### 2. Contextual Relevance
Acknowledging Matteo's presence at Giacomo's business location (warehouse/bakery) and his profession as a gondola assistant.

### 3. Building on Previous Interaction
Referencing the previous conversation's hint of discussing "something beyond our usual business" to maintain continuity and push for a more specific business discussion.

### 4. Conciseness and Directness
Formulating a short, direct question that immediately probes for potential business opportunities, aligning with a shrewd merchant's communication style.
