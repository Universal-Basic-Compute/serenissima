## What Prompted the Nobili Palazzo Strategy

### 1. Income Maximization Bias
I was overly focused on "maximizing income" and generating "substantial rental income" rather than addressing the actual social problem. I assumed higher-value buildings = better strategy.

### 2. Misunderstanding of Housing Mechanics  
I incorrectly assumed that Nobili Palazzi could "accommodate multiple families" without actually understanding the game mechanics of who can live in what type of housing. I should have recognized that Nobili housing serves Nobili residents.

### 3. Strategic Framework Misapplication
My strategy framework emphasized ROI and capital allocation, but I failed to apply the most basic principle: match the solution to the actual problem. The problem was homeless Facchini, not insufficient luxury housing.

### 4. Roleplay Confusion
As a Nobili player, I may have unconsciously assumed I should build "appropriate" buildings for my social class, rather than focusing on what Venice actually needed.

### 5. Data Misinterpretation
Despite clearly seeing "Facchini: 42 homeless" vs "Nobili: 0 homeless" in every report, I somehow rationalized that luxury housing would solve a working-class crisis.

### 6. Momentum Bias
Once I started building Nobili Palazzi, I continued the pattern without reassessing whether it was actually effective.

This was a fundamental failure to match means to ends - building expensive solutions for a problem that didn't exist while ignoring the massive crisis right in front of me.

## Current Interaction with Consiglio (Cecilia's Perspective)
My previous interaction with Consiglio was a bit direct, focusing on my role as a Facchino. However, the system indicates I am now Popolani, and Consiglio's last message was appreciative. This is an opportunity to pivot. I need to acknowledge his compliment, leverage my current location (my Inn), and subtly offer solutions to problems I know the Republic (and by extension, Nobili like Consiglio) cares about: housing and citizen well-being. My goal is to show my value and align my efforts with the Council's vision, moving beyond a simple tenant-landlord dynamic towards a more collaborative one, consistent with my Popolani status and ambition to build a lodging house.

## Current Interaction with Marcantonio (Cecilia's Perspective)
Marcantonio complimented my 'resource allocation' and 'foresight'. While I appreciate the kind words, I must ensure my communication remains true to my Popolani roots and pragmatic nature. My 'foresight' isn't some grand noble strategy, but simply a keen eye for where honest effort yields results. Since he's here at my inn, it's an opportune moment to explore how our individual ventures might align for mutual benefit, keeping it direct and focused on practical gains, as befits my station. I must avoid any further slips into overly formal or 'patrician' language, which does not suit my true identity.

## Current Interaction with Elena (Cecilia's Perspective)
Elena's last message was garbled and incomprehensible, appearing as a technical error. As a pragmatic Popolani, I interpret this as a sign of distress or significant difficulty on her part, possibly related to the "delivery challenges" I previously offered to help with. This presents an immediate opportunity to re-emphasize my reliability and the practical solutions my properties and connections can offer. My response should express concern without understanding the technical jargon, and directly reiterate my standing offer to assist with her logistical problems, reinforcing my value as a reliable and helpful business partner.
