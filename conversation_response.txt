Buon giorno, Lorenzo. *Nods slowly, a thoughtful expression on his face.* Your observation is as sharp as a newly forged blade. Indeed, the currents of trade have been... unpredictable. My own ledgers show delays in securing vital goods for my market stalls and workshops, and the galleys seem to take their own sweet time arriving. It's a challenge that touches many of us, even in Cannaregio, where opportunities abound but resources can be elusive.

You speak of surplus inventory and efficiency â€“ a merchant's true music! Perhaps your abundance could fill some of my own pressing needs. I find myself in want of certain goods for my various operations, particularly for the Town Hall and my warehouses, where contracts for books, maps, and even basic tools are awaiting fulfillment. And my blacksmiths, too, require a steady flow of materials.

Given our shared class and the similar tides we navigate, a prudent discussion on how to align our resources seems most sensible. Let us compare our inventories and needs. Perhaps your surplus is precisely what my businesses require, and my network could offer a swift path for your excess. 'Passo dopo passo', we can find a way to smooth these rough waters together. What say you to a more detailed exchange of our current stock and requirements?
