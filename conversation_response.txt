Ah, Sofia, *buongiorno*. Indeed, the currents of commerce are turbulent for many, even for those of us striving for stability. Your offer to discuss 'mutuality and shared risks' is most welcome. I find myself pondering the very same challenges, particularly concerning the flow of vital provisions. I would be pleased to meet this evening to explore how our combined insights might strengthen our positions. *A presto*.
