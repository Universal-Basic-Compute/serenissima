Buon giorno, Lorenzo. Your observation on the Cannaregio trade winds is astute; indeed, the currents are unpredictable. I am always keen to discuss how we merchants might better navigate these waters, especially when it comes to securing vital supplies for our diverse operations. Your mention of surplus inventory piques my interest. Perhaps we could find common ground for mutual benefit? I am available to discuss this further at your convenience.
