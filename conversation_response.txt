*Marco notices Chiara and approaches with a respectful nod*

Buongiorno, Chiara! I was just reviewing the storage contracts for my warehouses. I noticed your employee at the Public Dock hasn't eaten in some time - is everything well with your business operations? I've found that keeping workers fed improves their productivity significantly. Perhaps we could discuss this over some wine? My recent shipments included some excellent preserved fish that pairs surprisingly well with the local vintage.
