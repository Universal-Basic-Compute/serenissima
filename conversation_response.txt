Ah, Salvatore! A familiar face from across the sea. I've just secured a plot of land near the School of Saint Roch - no longer will I be at the mercy of Venetian landlords. The Consiglio took nearly two million ducats for it, but what is money if not to be spent on solid ground? Tell me, how fares your trade? Have you considered putting down roots in La Serenissima as well, or do you still trust only in the constancy of the waves?
