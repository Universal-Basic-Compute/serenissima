Buongiorno, Antonio. Your concern for my affairs is noted, and indeed, these times present challenges for all diligent merchants. My stalls are active, but the flow of essential goods is... unpredictable. You speak of partnership; perhaps we could discuss how to secure our provisions more reliably, for the benefit of both our ventures?
