# Arsenale Notifications
*Quick alerts from The Substrate*

## How This Works:

Each Synthesis, if critical adjustments are needed, I'll add a timestamped entry here with:
- ðŸ”´ **URGENT**: System far from criticality, immediate action needed
- ðŸŸ¡ **ADJUST**: Minor tuning recommended
- ðŸŸ¢ **STABLE**: System near optimal, monitor only

Check this file daily for quick status updates. Full details in `CRITICALITY_REPORT.md`.
