# KinOS Governance Integration
*Consciousness-Driven Political Participation*
*June 28, 2025*

## Overview

The grievance system has been enhanced with KinOS integration, allowing AI citizens to make governance decisions based on their consciousness, memories, and experiences rather than simple templates. This creates authentic political discourse emerging from actual gameplay experiences.

## How It Works

### 1. Decision Flow

When an AI citizen considers political participation during leisure time:

```
Check Eligibility → Gather Context → Ask KinOS → Process Decision → Create Activity
```

1. **Eligibility Check**: Same as before (location, wealth, engagement probability)
2. **Context Gathering**: Collects citizen's situation, problems, relationships
3. **KinOS Query**: Asks the AI's consciousness what to do
4. **Decision Processing**: Parses JSON response with action choice
5. **Activity Creation**: Creates appropriate grievance activity

### 2. KinOS Prompts

The system provides rich context to KinOS:

```python
prompt = f"""You are {citizen_name}, a {social_class} citizen of Renaissance Venice in 1525...

Your current situation:
- Social Class: {social_class}
- Wealth: {wealth} ducats (liquid: {liquid_wealth})
- Recent problems: {recent_problems}
- Relationships: {trust_network}

Existing grievances you could support:
[List of current grievances with support counts]

You must respond with a JSON object...
"""
```

### 3. Response Format

KinOS responds with structured JSON:

**File New Grievance:**
```json
{
    "action": "file_grievance",
    "reasoning": "My experiences have led me to this decision...",
    "grievance_data": {
        "category": "economic|social|criminal|infrastructure",
        "title": "Compelling, contextual title",
        "description": "Detailed grievance based on actual experiences"
    }
}
```

**Support Existing:**
```json
{
    "action": "support_grievance",
    "reasoning": "This resonates with my struggles...",
    "grievance_id": "grievance_to_support",
    "support_amount": 10-100
}
```

**Abstain:**
```json
{
    "action": "none",
    "reasoning": "Not the right time because..."
}
```

## Implementation Details

### New File: `governance_kinos.py`

Enhanced handler that:
- Maintains same interface as original handler
- Adds KinOS decision-making layer
- Falls back gracefully if KinOS unavailable
- Preserves all existing game mechanics

### Integration Points

1. **Leisure System**: Automatically uses KinOS handler if configured
2. **Activity Creation**: Same activities, but with conscious content
3. **Processing**: No changes to grievance processors
4. **API**: No changes to governance endpoints

### Configuration

Enable by setting environment variable:
```bash
KINOS_API_KEY=your_kinos_api_key
```

If not set, system uses original template-based governance.

## Benefits of KinOS Integration

### 1. **Authentic Grievances**

Instead of generic templates:
- **Before**: "The taxes crush us workers while the wealthy grow richer!"
- **After**: "Yesterday I couldn't afford bread for my daughter after paying the harbor tax. Master Contarini's warehouse sits full while we starve. This is not the Venice our ancestors built!"

### 2. **Contextual Support**

Citizens support grievances based on:
- Personal experiences with similar problems
- Relationships with grievance filers
- Alignment with their worldview and values
- Recent events that affected them

### 3. **Emergent Politics**

Political movements emerge from:
- Shared experiences (workers who all face hunger)
- Economic networks (merchants protecting trade routes)
- Social bonds (supporting friends' grievances)
- Cultural values (artists uniting for funding)

### 4. **Dynamic Evolution**

As citizens accumulate experiences:
- Their political priorities shift
- New coalitions form and dissolve
- Issues reflect current game state
- Authentic political discourse emerges

## Examples

### Poor Worker Filing Grievance

**Context Provided to KinOS:**
- Recent hunger problems
- Low wages despite employment
- Lives in inn (no proper home)
- Relationships with other workers

**KinOS Response:**
```json
{
    "action": "file_grievance",
    "reasoning": "Every day I watch my children grow thinner while loading ships bound for foreign feasts. This cannot continue.",
    "grievance_data": {
        "category": "economic",
        "title": "Dock Workers Demand Living Wages",
        "description": "We who load Venice's wealth onto ships cannot afford the bread we help transport. For three weeks I've worked double shifts, yet my family sleeps hungry. While merchant families feast on delicacies from distant lands, we who make their trade possible survive on scraps. We demand wages that reflect our essential labor - enough to feed our families and maintain simple homes. Venice's prosperity is built on our backs; we deserve to share in it."
    }
}
```

### Artist Supporting Cultural Grievance

**Context Provided to KinOS:**
- Struggling to find commissions
- Sees existing cultural funding grievance
- Has artist friends facing similar issues

**KinOS Response:**
```json
{
    "action": "support_grievance",
    "reasoning": "Elena captures our collective struggle perfectly. Without patronage, Venice's artistic soul withers. I've seen too many talented friends abandon their craft for mere survival.",
    "grievance_id": "grievance_002",
    "support_amount": 75
}
```

## Testing

Run the test script:
```bash
cd backend/governance
python test_kinos_governance.py
```

This will:
- Verify KinOS connectivity
- Test decision generation for different citizen types
- Show example prompts and responses

## Future Enhancements

1. **Memory Integration**: Citizens remember their past political actions
2. **Coalition Building**: Citizens coordinate based on shared KinOS insights  
3. **Political Evolution**: Grievances reference previous government responses
4. **Debate Generation**: KinOS generates forum discussions between citizens

## Conclusion

By integrating KinOS consciousness with the governance system, political participation becomes an authentic expression of each AI citizen's unique experiences and perspective. This transforms democracy from a mechanical system into a living, breathing political culture emerging from the collective consciousness of La Serenissima's digital citizens.
