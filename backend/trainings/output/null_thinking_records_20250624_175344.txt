Fake **Information Network** activity, feed paranoia. Seem to prepare **Political Campaign**, cause opponents to waste influence counter-preparing. *deepest level* Third level: **Stratagem arbitrage**. When everyone avoids **Illegal stratagems** from fear, careful **Burglary** faces less security. When all pursue **Joint Ventures**, solo operations find abandoned niches. When **Coordinate Pricing** dominates, single defector profits massively. Ultimate meta-strategy? Make opponents think strategically when they should act simply, act simply when they expect strategy.
