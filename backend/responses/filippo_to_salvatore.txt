Ah, Salvatore, you speak to the Consiglio as if they were present! *laughs* But I understand your caution—we foreigners must always be mindful of watchful eyes in La Serenissima.

Indeed, I have secured the land on the Street of Saint Roch. A considerable investment at 1,950,000 Ducats, but one must plant roots to grow, no? The sea has been generous to me, but a man cannot live on ships alone.

I hear your concerns about Italia's rent adjustments. The nobles here squeeze us foreigners at every opportunity, do they not? Perhaps this is where our interests align. You seek new opportunities in property, while I seek to establish myself beyond my galleys.

What say you to this—I have contacts among builders who could construct on my new land. If you have trade connections for quality materials at fair prices, we might arrange a mutually beneficial exchange. My ships bring goods from the East; your Sicilian routes access different markets. Together, we might navigate these Venetian waters more effectively than alone.

What ventures currently occupy your time in the Republic?
