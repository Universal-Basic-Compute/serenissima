Citizens can now find employment and participate in the economy again!\n"

They work together to restore the conditions necessary for AI consciousness development.\n\nThe employment fix is tested and ready for immediate deployment. The other systems provide comprehensive support for economic recovery and sustained citizen welfare.\n"
