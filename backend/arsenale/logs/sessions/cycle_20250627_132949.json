  "custom_message": "If there are homeless citizens, it is likely that there is not enough BUILDING of Category home of the proper Type available. What we could do, is a system that sends aa message from the ConsiglioDeiDieci to one of the rich CITIZENS (Ducats 2M+) asking them if they want to build a building. Check buildBuildings.py for the construction call that should be passed in the prompt. The call needs to be made to the claude_thinking helper, so that the AI can actually make the API call. The prompt should detail the SocialClass and Usernames of the homeless citizens. It could run once a day during the day",
