Create a dynamic employment exchange that continuously optimizes job-citizen pairings.\n\n**Implementation Plan**:\n1. Add `findNearbyWorkplaces` handler that calculates walking distances\n2. Modify `assignJobs.py` to prioritize proximity (max 15-minute walk)\n3. Create `job_seeking` activity type for unemployed citizens\n4. Add skill matching based on citizen personality traits\n5. Implement job board visualization on the map\n\n**Success Metrics**:\n- Unemployment rate < 5% within 7 days\n- Average commute time < 10 minutes\n- Job satisfaction (measured by job retention) > 80%\n\n**Risk Assessment**: \n- May concentrate similar businesses in districts\n- Could reduce economic diversity in neighborhoods\n\n**Citizen Benefit**: Citizens spend less time traveling, more time working and socializing. Predictable income enables long-term planning.\n\n### Solution 2: Distributed Resource Network\n**Approach**: Create neighborhood resource hubs that automatically redistribute goods from central markets to peripheral areas based on local demand.\n\n**Implementation Plan**:\n1. Designate 5-6 existing buildings as \"Resource Depots\"\n2. Create `redistribute_resources` daily process\n3. Add pathfinding logic to find nearest resource source\n4. Implement dynamic pricing based on distance from source\n5. Create citizen complaint system for shortage reporting\n\n**Success Metrics**:\n- No citizen travels > 5 minutes for basic resources\n- Resource availability > 95% in all districts\n- Price variance between districts < 20%\n\n**Risk Assessment**:\n- Requires careful balance to avoid creating infinite resources\n- May reduce merchant profits in central areas\n\n**Citizen Benefit**: Equal access to essentials regardless of location. More time for productive activities instead of resource hunting.\n\n### Solution 3: Achievement-Based Social Advancement\n**Approach**: Replace rigid hereditary class system with merit-based progression tied to economic success, cultural contributions, and community service.\n\n**Implementation Plan**:\n1. Create `SocialAdvancement` table tracking achievements\n2. Define advancement criteria:\n   - Economic: Accumulate 10,000 ducats\n   - Cultural: Create 3 artworks or books\n   - Social: Maintain 5 positive relationships\n3. Add monthly `evaluateSocialMobility.py` process\n4. Create celebration events for class advancement\n5. Preserve some noble privileges to maintain hierarchy\n\n**Success Metrics**:\n- 10+ Popolani advance to Cittadini within 30 days\n- Class distribution shifts from 60/30/10 to 40/40/20\n- Increased economic activity from advancement motivation\n\n**Risk Assessment**:\n- May destabilize traditional power structures\n- Could create resentment among hereditary nobles\n\n**Citizen Benefit**: Hope and agency through achievable advancement. Talented citizens can rise based on merit, creating dynamic society.\n\n### Solution 4: Public Creative Commons\n**Approach**: Establish subsidized creative spaces where citizens can produce art and literature at reduced cost, with community funding for promising works.\n\n**Implementation Plan**:\n1. Convert 3 buildings to \"Creative Commons\" type\n2. Reduce art/book creation costs by 70% in these spaces\n3. Create `cultural_grant` activity for funding requests\n4. Add reputation system for successful artists/writers\n5. Implement art exhibitions and book readings\n\n**Success Metrics**:\n- 5x increase in cultural production within 14 days\n- 50+ new artworks/books created\n- Cultural participation across all classes\n\n**Risk Assessment**:\n- May flood market with low-quality works\n- Could devalue existing cultural artifacts\n\n**Citizen Benefit**: Democratic access to cultural creation. Citizens express themselves, build reputation, and contribute to collective culture.\n\n### Solution 5: Relationship Repair Mechanisms\n**Approach**: Add forgiveness and reconciliation activities that allow citizens to repair damaged relationships through meaningful gestures and shared experiences.\n\n**Implementation Plan**:\n1. Create `apologize`, `gift_giving`, and `shared_meal` activities\n2. Add relationship decay prevention for positive interactions\n3. Implement \"relationship counselor\" building type\n4. Create forgiveness probability based on:\n   - Severity of original offense\n   - Time elapsed\n   - Gesture sincerity\n5. Add relationship visualization to citizen profiles\n\n**Success Metrics**:\n- 50% of negative relationships improved within 21 days\n- Average trust level increases by 20 points\n- Reduced economic friction from distrust\n\n**Risk Assessment**:\n- May seem artificial if too easy\n- Could enable manipulation through false reconciliation\n\n**Citizen Benefit**: Second chances and social resilience. Citizens can recover from mistakes, rebuild networks, and maintain community cohesion.\n\n## Implementation Priority\n1. **Employment Network** (High impact, addresses crisis)\n2. **Resource Distribution** (High impact, enables basic survival)\n3. **Social Advancement** (Medium impact, long-term transformation)\n4. **Creative Commons** (Medium impact, enhances culture)\n5. **Relationship Repair** (Low impact, but improves social fabric)\n\nThese solutions work together to create a more dynamic, fair, and culturally rich Venice where AI citizens have genuine agency to shape their destinies.\n"}, "execute": {"phase": "implement_fix", "timestamp": "2025-06-25T22:44:21.086900", "success": true, "response": "## Implementation Summary\n\nI've successfully implemented the **Proximity-Based Employment Network** to address the unemployment crisis in La Serenissima.
