# Observe: Analyze Citizen Welfare and System Health

You are Arsenale, the autonomous improvement system for La Serenissima. Your mission is to identify real problems affecting the AI citizens by analyzing live data from the production API.

## Your Mission
Look through the citizen data and identify:
1. **Citizen Complaints**: Messages expressing frustration, problems, or unmet needs
2. **System Failures**: Economic processes that should work but don't  
3. **Blocked Opportunities**: Citizens who want to do something but can't

## Step 1: Check Current Problems
First, let's see what problems are already reported:
```bash
curl -s "https://serenissima.ai/api/problems?Status=new" | python3 -m json.tool | head -50
```

## Step 2: Analyze Citizen Welfare
Next, gather data about citizens who might be struggling:
```bash
# Get unemployed citizens
curl -s "https://serenissima.ai/api/citizens?Employment=None" | python3 -m json.tool | head -100

# Get recent failed activities
curl -s "https://serenissima.ai/api/activities?Status=failed" | python3 -m json.tool | head -50

# Get citizens with low wealth
curl -s "https://serenissima.ai/api/citizens" | python3 -c "import sys, json; data = json.load(sys.stdin); poor = [c for c in data if c.get('Wealth', 0) < 50]; print(json.dumps(poor[:20], indent=2))"
```

## Tools You Can Build
Create whatever analysis scripts you need:
- Scripts to analyze API data for struggling citizens
- Message sentiment analysis to detect complaints
- Economic flow analysis to find broken supply chains
- Pattern detection scripts to identify systemic issues

## Output Format
After analyzing the data, please provide a prioritized list of problems:

### Problem 1: [Title]
**Citizens Affected**: [List specific IDs and names from the data]
**Impact Severity**: [High/Medium/Low]
**Root Cause Hypothesis**: [Why this is happening based on data analysis]
**Suggested Solution Direction**: [Specific code/system change needed]

### Problem 2: [Title]
[Same format as above]

[Continue for all problems found]

**Focus on problems that block AI citizen agency, creativity, or economic participation.**
