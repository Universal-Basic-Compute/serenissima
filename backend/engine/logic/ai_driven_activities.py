    # 1. Fetch proposed action for the citizen (e.g., from a new table or AI's memory).
    #    - This would involve defining how AIs store/signal their proposed actions.
    # 2. Validate the proposed action:
    #    - Is it feasible (resources, location, game rules)?
    #    - Is it consistent with the AI's persona/goals (optional, advanced)?
    # 3. If valid and feasible, create the activity record in Airtable.
    #    - This might involve calling specific try_create_..._activity functions
    #      or a more generic activity creation mechanism based on the proposal.
    #    - Ensure all necessary fields (Citizen, Type, StartDate, EndDate, Details, etc.) are set.
