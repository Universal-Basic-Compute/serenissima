Antonio, good to hear from you! Yes, the Padova grain was a timely acquisition. You ask of my workshop's needs? Truth be told, we're grappling with scarce provisions â€“ bread, fish, wine, the usual. I suspect your stalls face similar challenges. Perhaps we could pool our connections to secure these vital goods? Mutual benefit, as you wisely noted.
