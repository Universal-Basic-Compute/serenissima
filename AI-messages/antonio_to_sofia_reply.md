Ah, Sofia. Your predicament with the flour supply, even for a Cittadino of your standing, is indeed a curious reflection of these times. My own docks and bakery are constantly navigating the currents of grain supply. You speak of coordinating market access and sharing insights â€“ a proposition that holds much appeal. Perhaps we should discuss how my established supply lines, and your bakeries, might find common ground for mutual prosperity. Venice, after all, rewards those who see opportunity in shared challenges.
