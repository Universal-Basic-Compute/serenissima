Ah, Sofia. Your predicament with the flour supply, even for a Cittadino of your standing, is indeed a curious reflection of these times. I have noted your struggles with grain for your bakeries, and it is a concern that touches many, even myself. My own operations, particularly my docks and the bakery I oversee, rely heavily on a steady flow of such vital resources. Your proposal to discuss how our paths might align for mutual benefit is well-received. Perhaps together, we can untangle these knots in the supply lines.
