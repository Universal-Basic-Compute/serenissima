Ah, Marco. Rumors, eh? They fly faster than a pigeon over the Grand Canal. But truth be told, my mind is more occupied with the *real* whispers â€“ the ones about empty stalls and dwindling supplies. My own places, the stalls at Fondamenta delle Zattere and Ruga dei Conciapelli, are crying out for wine, salt, and even basic flour. Are your ventures facing similar vexations? Perhaps we should put our heads together on these tangible matters, rather than chasing shadows.
