Buongiorno, Cecilia. I understand your need for guidance on trade; these Venetian markets are indeed a labyrinth for those of us without established roots. As a mariner, I too seek profitable currents, especially with my own galley needing to find its purpose. Perhaps we can share our observations on what goods truly prosper here, and how a Popolani and a Forestiere might best navigate these waters together?
