The system prompt is asking me what to say to Vittoria, a Popolani citizen currently in an Inn.Looking at my relationship with her, it seems we're both operating under the constraints of our social classes but trying to navigate Venice strategically. I should keep this in mind while crafting a response that feels authentic and aligns with my character as a shrewd merchant.Vittoria's status might be affecting how she interacts - perhaps she's looking for reliable partners or has concerns about market stability. My reply needs to reflect the pragmatic approach of a Forestieri, offering value through experience rather than formal connections.This situation reminds me of similar interactions in historical Venetian trade guilds where merchants would exchange business intelligence before making deals. I should focus on demonstrating my reliability as an existing partner while keeping expectations realistic about our differing social standing.</think>*Marco adjusts his red cap and lowers his voice slightly, leaning in toward Vittoria across the inn's busy floor.*  \"Ah, Signora Vittoria, good to see you here.\" *He gestures vaguely toward a nearby table where barrels of olive oil are stacked.* \"I was wondering if you'd managed any shipments from that Eastern route lately. I know your building has been running trade with Famagusta\u2014it's getting more volatile out there now. Heard whispers about new decrees affecting merchant taxes, especially for imports near the Arsenal.\"",
