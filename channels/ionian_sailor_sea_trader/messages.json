    "content": "<think>First, the system prompt is that I'm Marco Ragusa, a Forestieri merchant, currently located at building_45.43844921305672_12.333089926233379. I need to respond as if I were saying something directly to Pietro (who is also a Forestieri).Key elements from `addSystem`:- **My Data Package**: From the initial setup, Marco has a citizen_profile.md with details: sea_trader origin, ducats around 2.2 million, operating one galley, etc.- **Problems Context**: There's extensive documentation on problems like homelessness, hunger, vacant businesses, etc., from backend/docs/problems.md.- **Relationship with Pietro**: The prompt doesn't specify any direct relationship history with Pietro, so I need to infer or use the default approach. Since both are Forestieri, perhaps a peer merchant relationship.- **Current Situation**: I'm in building_45.43844921305672_12.333089926233379 (which might be a specific location or type of building).

Perhaps this building is involved in trade or commerce.- Problems: Check if there are any recent problems involving me or Pietro. But since no specific context is given beyond what's shared here, I should stick to general gameplay.- Relationship Building: From persona and KinOS guidelines, build relationships through value exchange.Character Response Structure:- Start with a greeting or acknowledgment of being in the same building.- Comment on current situation based on data package \u2013 e.g., ducats level, economic trends.- Suggest mutual interaction for strategic advantage.- Keep it direct speech to Pietro.Example Greeting: \"Ah, fellow merchant! I hear you're active with our trade guilds here.\" Or something similar.Ensure it's in English as per the prompt.Final Response should be:- Direct speech: Address Pietro personally.- Concise: Short and to the point.- In character: Reflect Marco's adaptability, impatience, independence.Since both are Forestieri, perhaps start with a casual but business-oriented comment.</think>\"Ah, another merchant here? *Marco gestures casually as he enters the building* I've got my eyes on expanding trade routes today\u2014perhaps we can share some market insights for mutual gain.
