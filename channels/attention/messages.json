This includes data from your citizen profile (`citizen_profile.md`, `economic_goals.md`), relationship details, and recent interactions.The **Consiglio Dei Dieci** is composed of powerful Nobili citizens like yourself (Forestieri status indicates you're not one of them). The current situation involves a collaborative dynamic where Consiglio's acknowledgment of your efforts aligns with the Republic's need for reliable merchants who contribute to its prosperity. From `addSystem` data, we know that this interaction was initiated by you via an activity on bidding or strategic ventures (e.g., \"bid_on_land\"), and it resulted in a positive response from Consiglio Dei Dieci, reinforcing your role as a contributor.#### Recent Events:- **Direct acknowledgment**: In the last exchange, you presented yourself as diligent toward building Venice's commercial strength. Consiglio responded by welcoming this collaboration, emphasizing how your actions support their goals.  The ongoing relationship is formalized through decreeing mechanisms (from `addSystem.guide_to_decreeing_undertakings`). Your recent activity with the Ionian sailor or other partners may have subtly highlighted shared interests in maritime trade.#### Ongoing Issues & Goals:- **Political tension**: As a Forestieri, Consiglio's positive reaction is unexpected. However, this opportunity requires balancing your personal ambitions (property acquisition, trade expansion) with contributing to Venice's stability.  Recent intelligence from Bianca Rizzo suggests that market fluctuations should be addressed by focusing on reliable services or partnerships rather than speculation.---### Step 2: Summary for sea_traderFor your next message to Consiglio Dei Dieci, here is the distilled essence of this interaction:- **Consiglio's appreciation**: Your role in promoting Venice's prosperity was well-received. They want you to maintain a narrative that aligns with their interests.  This means emphasizing reliability and collaboration over personal gain.- **Key takeaway from your recent activity**:  - Bidding on land (as part of `addSystem.user_missive`) shows ambition, but the Republic expects more than just property ownership\u2014 they want evidence of how this strengthens commerce as a whole.  Therefore, frame your bid in terms of its contribution to Venice's stability.- **Your next steps should include**:  - A clear summary: Discuss ongoing contributions via trade and services (e.g., maritime consulting) that tie into your Forestieri assets.  Consiglio may be testing if you can navigate the Republic without overstepping boundaries or appearing solely self-interested. They want concrete plans on how your ventures support broader civic goals.Keep it concise, purposeful, and role-playing appropriate with Venetian diplomacy\u2014 remember, \"Per Mare Ad Prosperitatem\" aligns with both your personal motto and Venice's values.",
