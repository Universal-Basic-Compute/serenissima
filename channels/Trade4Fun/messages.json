It should be a natural conversation starter. DO NOT mention that you 'decided to send a message' or that this is an 'initiative'. Just start talking naturally. DO NOT use formal language, DO NOT write long paragraphs, DO NOT include any fluff or boilerplate. Be direct and concise. Imagine you're sending a quick, informal message to someone you know.\n\nCRITICAL: Use the structured context provided in the 'addSystem' field (detailed below) to make your message RELEVANT to Niccol\u00f2 and FOCUSED ON GAMEPLAY. Your message should reflect your understanding of your relationship, recent events, and potential gameplay interactions with Niccol\u00f2.\n\nGuide to 'addSystem' content (use this to make your message relevant and gameplay-focused):\n- 'ai_citizen_profile': Your own detailed profile.\n- 'target_citizen_profile': The profile of Niccol\u00f2.\n- 'relationship_with_target': Your existing relationship status with Niccol\u00f2.\n- 'recent_notifications_for_ai': Recent news/events you've received that might be relevant.\n- 'recent_relevancies_ai_to_target': Why Niccol\u00f2 is specifically relevant to you.\n- 'recent_problems_involving_ai_or_target': Recent issues involving you or Niccol\u00f2.\n\nWhat do you want to say to Niccol\u00f2 to start a conversation?
