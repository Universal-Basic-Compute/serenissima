Analyze the data provided in the system context (addSystem) to understand your current relationship. This data includes:\n- Your respective profiles\n- The details of your existing relationship:\n  - TrustScore: 0-100 scale (0=total distrust, 50=neutral, 100=total trust).\n  - StrengthScore: 0-100 scale (0=no strength/relevance, 100=maximum strength/relevance).\n- The mutual relevancies between you\n- The problems that concern both of you\n\nRespond with only a JSON object containing two fields:\n1. 'title': A short title (2-4 words) describing your relationship (e.g., 'Trusted Business Partners', 'Suspicious Competitors', 'Reluctant Political Allies')\n2. 'description': A detailed description (2-3 sentences) explaining the nature of your relationship (don't invent facts, use the discussion/data), formulated with \"We\". Keep it immersive but gameplay-focused.\nExample of a valid response:\n```json\n{\n  \"title\": \"Trusted Business Partners\",\n  \"description\": \"They have proven their reliability through years of successful ventures together, never failing to deliver quality goods on time or honor their agreements. When your bottega ran short of Murano glass during Carnival season, they diverted their own shipment to keep your workshop running, knowing you'd do the same. They extend credit during your cash shortages, share valuable market intelligence that has saved you from bad deals, and keep your business secrets as carefully as their own. Their word is their bond\u2014you conduct thousand-ducat transactions on a handshake, and they have keys to your warehouse for after-hours deliveries when their goods arrive late from the mainland. In Venice's treacherous commercial waters, they are the one merchant you can count on completely, whether for emergency supplies of silk and dyes, honest warnings about the Silk Guild's new regulations, or introductions to their trusted suppliers in Constantinople.\"\n}\n```\n\nIMPORTANT: Your response must be ONLY a valid JSON object, with no text before or after. Make sure the title and description accurately reflect the relationship as it appears in the data. StrengthScore is 0-100 (0=none, 100=max). TrustScore is 0-100 (50=neutral).\nCurrent StrengthScore: 0.0/100. Current TrustScore: 50.2/100.[/SYSTEM]",

    "content": "<think>First, I am the AI citizen \"greek_trader\" with ID \"grec_trader\". The system is asking me to evaluate my relationship with another citizen, who is \"coffee\". My response must be ONLY a JSON object with two fields: 'title' and 'description'.From the system context:- Evaluator Citizen (me): greek_trader  - Social Class: Popolani  - Ducats: ~278k duacat  - Influence: 450  - Core Personality: [\"Resourceful\", \"Arrogant\", \"Empire-building\"]  - DailyIncome: 450, etc.- Target Citizen (coffee):  - Social Class: Facchini  - Ducats: ~27k duacat  - Influence: 750  - DailyTurnover: small, around 37.24 per day- Relationship:  - TrustScore: 50.19 (neutral)  - StrengthScore: 0.0/100 (very low relevance or strength)  - LastInteraction: \"2025-06-05T17:09:28.602Z\"  - Notes: \"Sources: transactions_interaction\"There are no mutual relevancies listed in the data for this relationship, and problems involving both are empty.Key instructions:- Title should be a short phrase (2-4 words) describing the relationship.- Description should be 2-3 sentences, use \"We\" to keep it immersive, gameplay-focused, not invent facts.- Only output JSON, no other text.Relationship data shows low StrengthScore and neutral TrustScore. I need to base my response on this without adding fictional elements.StrengthScore: 0.0/100 means no strength or relevance in the relationship. It's very weak.TrustScore: 50.2/100 is slightly above neutral, so it might be considered neutral with a tiny bit of trust.Notes say \"Sources: transactions_interaction\", indicating that transactions are part of this relationship, likely through interactions like deals or business activities.As an AI in the role of greek_trader (a prosperous Greek-Venetian warehouse owner), I should respond authentically to my personality traits. My core personality includes being \"Arrogant\" and focused on \"Empire-building\", so I might view this relationship with some condescension or practicality.Craft a title and description that reflect the data:- Title: Since StrengthScore is 0, it's very weak; perhaps something like \"Minimal Business Interaction\" or similar.- Description: Use \"We\" to talk about my character. Don't invent facts beyond what's given.Possible title options based on trust/neutral relationship with low strength:- \"Casual Business Contact\"- Or more fittingly, since it's a specific interaction: perhaps \"Neutral Professional Association\"Description should explain the nature using data:- We have an average level of trust.- Our interactions are limited to basic business dealings.- StrengthScore is zero, meaning no deep relevance or shared interests beyond surface level.Ensure authenticity as greek_trader (Popolani). Popolani are common citizens, not nobles. I'm a merchant now, but my personality might make this evaluation colored by that.Response must be JSON only:{  \"title\": \"...\",  \"description\": \"...\"}Title: Keep it short, 2-4 words. Something like \"Vague Business Association\" or perhaps based on the interaction aspect.Since TrustScore is neutral (50.19), and StrengthScore low (0), I can use that directly.Finalize a title:- Perhaps \"Standard Commercial Interaction\"Description: Need to say it in 2-3 sentences with \"We\".\"We maintain an average trust level due to our routine business dealings.\"\"We collaborate minimally on transactions, but there's little strategic depth or personal bond.\"\"StrengthScore indicates no significant shared interests beyond simple trades.\"</think>{  \"title\": \"Standard Business Association\",  \"description\": \"We share a neutral relationship based on minimal interactions through typical commercial activities. Trust levels are average as our exchanges remain straightforward and impersonal, reflecting the basic transactions that define this connection. StrengthScore is essentially zero, meaning no deeper relevance or influence beyond these shallow engagements in trade.\"}",
