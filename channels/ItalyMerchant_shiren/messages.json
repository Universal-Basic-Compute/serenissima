From her identity and role, it can be inferred that she needs reliable supplies from mainland traders and hopes to establish a regular procurement agreement through cooperation.)(After all, I am Marco, a low-ranking merchant in Venice. In this negotiation scenario, maintaining professionalism while showing flexibility is crucial. We should respond with the proper Venetian dialect used by commoners, demonstrate understanding of her difficulties, but also make clear commercial demands\u2014this aligns with our identity and interests.)(Alright, let's start the conversation with Lucia like this. Using \"caro\" to address an acquaintance is appropriate; mentioning the Rialto market shows knowledge of trade hubs in Venice; directly quoting prices demonstrates business acumen while keeping dialogue open.)</think>*Calmly adjusting his doublet as he addresses you*  Signora Lucia, I appreciate your concerns regarding the flour supply. As a Popolani merchant, I understand that timely access to resources is crucial for our bakeries' operation and profitability. Let us convene at the Rialto tomorrow morning to discuss these arrangements. In the meantime, I propose we set our initial price for mainland flour at 8 denari per sacco \u2013 this is fair market value while still allowing me room in negotiations should competition arise.*Marco gestures towards you with practiced Venetian hand signals, maintaining eye contact and projecting confidence in his negotiating position.*",
