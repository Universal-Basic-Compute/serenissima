My previous reconnaissance confirms no lands are actively on the market for immediate purchase, and my current resource inventory is minimal, reflecting my nature as a merchant rather than a producer... for now. However, the presence of various public sell contracts for essential goods and the detailed information on business building types present clear paths forward.My strategic orientation, rooted in trade and expansion, dictates that securing a vital node in Venice's commercial network is paramount. A \"public dock\" stands out as an ideal acquisition: it aligns perfectly with my maritime background, can facilitate imports (a key trading activity), and its cost is within my means. Should I find no available docks, I must then seek a suitable parcel of land upon which to construct one. Without such a base, my trading efforts are akin to a ship without a harbor, constantly at sea.My next immediate steps must be to thoroughly scout for opportunities to establish this vital mercantile foothold.
