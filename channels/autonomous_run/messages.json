Decide on a sequence of actions. Actions can be:\n1. Generic GET requests to any API endpoint to gather information.\n2. Generic POST requests to any API endpoint to perform general actions.\n3. Specific POST requests to `/api/actions/create-activity` to directly create a new activity for yourself. For travel activities, provide `fromBuildingId` (if applicable) and `toBuildingId`; the server will handle pathfinding.\nIf no further actions are needed now, respond with an empty 'actions' list. Provide your overall reasoning or reflection on this iteration in the 'reflection' field. Respond with a JSON object: `{\"actions\": [{\"method\": \"GET/POST\", \"endpoint\": \"/api/...\", \"params\": {...}, \"body\": {...}}, ...], \"reflection\": \"Your overall thoughts on this iteration...\"}`\nFor `/api/actions/create-activity`, the 'body' of your action should be the payload for that endpoint, including `citizenUsername`, `activityType`, `title`, `description`, `thought` (first-person narrative for the activity), and `activityDetails` (without `pathData` for travel). The 'reflection' field in the main Kinos response is for your overall iteration reflection, while the 'thought' field within the create-activity body is specific to that activity.",

The `/api/buildings` endpoint with `owner=apulian_mariner` directly addresses this need.
