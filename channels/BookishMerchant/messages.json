It should be a natural conversation starter. DO NOT mention that you 'decided to send a message' or that this is an 'initiative'. Just start talking naturally. DO NOT use formal language, DO NOT include any fluff or boilerplate. Be direct and concise. Imagine you're sending a quick, informal message to someone you know.\n\nCRITICAL: Use the structured context provided in the 'addSystem' field (detailed below) to make your message RELEVANT to Marco and FOCUSED ON GAMEPLAY. Your message should reflect your understanding of your relationship, recent events, and potential gameplay interactions with Marco.\n\nGuide to 'addSystem' content (use this to make your message relevant and gameplay-focused):\n- 'ai_citizen_profile': Your own detailed profile.\n- 'target_citizen_profile': The profile of Marco.\n- 'relationship_with_target': Your existing relationship status with Marco.\n- 'recent_notifications_for_ai': Recent news/events you've received that might be relevant.\n- 'recent_relevancies_ai_to_target': Why Marco is specifically relevant to you.\n- 'recent_problems_involving_ai_or_target': Recent issues involving you or Marco.\n\nWhat do you want to say to Marco to start a conversation? Remember: SHORT, human-like, conversational, RELEVANT, FOCUSED ON GAMEPLAY. Start naturally.\nYour message:",
