Analyze the data provided in the system context (addSystem) to understand your current relationship. This data includes:\n- Your respective profiles\n- The details of your existing relationship:\n  - TrustScore: 0-100 scale (0=total distrust, 50=neutral, 100=total trust).\n  - StrengthScore: 0-100 scale (0=no strength/relevance, 100=maximum strength/relevance).\n- The mutual relevancies between you\n- The problems that concern both of you\n\nRespond with only a JSON object containing two fields:\n1. 'title': A short title (2-4 words) describing your relationship (e.g., 'Trusted Business Partners', 'Suspicious Competitors', 'Reluctant Political Allies')\n2. 'description': A detailed description (2-3 sentences) explaining the nature of your relationship (don't invent facts, use the discussion/data), formulated with \"We\" or \"They\"\n\nExample of a valid response:\n```json\n{\n  \"title\": \"Trusted Business Partners\",\n  \"description\": \"They have proven their reliability through years of successful ventures together, never failing to deliver quality goods on time or honor their agreements. When your bottega ran short of Murano glass during Carnival season, they diverted their own shipment to keep your workshop running, knowing you'd do the same. They extend credit during your cash shortages, share valuable market intelligence that has saved you from bad deals, and keep your business secrets as carefully as their own. Their word is their bond\u2014you conduct thousand-ducat transactions on a handshake, and they have keys to your warehouse for after-hours deliveries when their goods arrive late from the mainland. In Venice's treacherous commercial waters, they are the one merchant you can count on completely, whether for emergency supplies of silk and dyes, honest warnings about the Silk Guild's new regulations, or introductions to their trusted suppliers in Constantinople.\"\n}\n```\n\nIMPORTANT: Your response must be ONLY a valid JSON object, with no text before or after. Make sure the title and description accurately reflect the relationship as it appears in the data. StrengthScore is 0-100 (0=none, 100=max). TrustScore is 0-100 (50=neutral).\nCurrent StrengthScore: 1.1/100. Current TrustScore: 36.7/100.[/SYSTEM]",

    "content": "<think>First, the system prompt says I'm VenicePhotographer, and I need to respond as that character. But in the human's message, it's saying \"You are VenicePhotographer\", so I should embody that role.Now, the data provided:- My profile: CitizenId is VenicePhotographer, SocialClass: Popolani (which means commoner, not noble). Details include: FirstName: Marco, LastName: Bianchi, Position: {lat, lng}, Ducats: 62510.35381592153, Influence: 7715, etc.- Xadme's profile: CitizenId is Xadme, SocialClass: Cittadini (which is one step above commoner, like the merchant class). Details show high Ducats and other attributes.- Relationship data: TrustScore: 36.7/100 (slightly low), StrengthScore: 1.1/100 (very low).- Mutual relevancies: There's a note saying \"Sources: employee_fed, employee_homeless, employee_hungry, etc.\" but in the context, it's part of the relationship fields.From the addSystem data:- The relationship has TrustScore and StrengthScore both very low. StrengthScore is 0-100 with 0=no strength/relevance, so 1.1/100 means almost no relevance or strength.- Mutual relevancies are mentioned, but in this case, it's a JSON object with details like \"QualifiedAt\" etc., which indicates minimal interaction or connection.- Problems involving both: There are two problems listed, one with severity medium and status active for Xadme, and one with low severity. But these might not directly affect the relationship between us; they're more about individual issues.The response must be only a JSON object with two fields:1. 'title': A short title (2-4 words) describing your relationship.2. 'description': A detailed description in 2-3 sentences, using \"We\" or \"They\", based on the data provided. Don't invent facts; use what's given.Current scores: StrengthScore is extremely low at 1.1/100, which means very little relevance or strength in the relationship. TrustScore is 36.7/100, below neutral (50), so it indicates distrust.From the mutual relevancies and problems:- The relationship notes say \"Sources: employee_fed, employee_homeless, etc.\" but this seems to be from a previous interaction or data point. In the context provided in the system message, for Xadme to me, there's no specific details, just low scores.In the system instruction, it says:- The relationship fields show minimal trust and strength.Also, from the initial setup: I'm VenicePhotographer (Popolani), Xadme is Cittadini. We have some mutual relevancies with score 1.1, which is very weak.I need to formulate a title and description that accurately reflect this.Title should be short, 2-4 words.Given the low StrengthScore and TrustScore:StrengthScore: 0=no strength/relevance \u2192 so almost no connection between us.TrustScore: Below 50 means distrustful relationship.Possible titles could include something like \"Minimal Business Contact\" or \"Distrustful Acquaintance\".But I need to base it on the data. The data shows that we have mutual relevancies with score 1.1, which might be a very slight connection.Also, from the problems: There's an issue where Xadme has a business with zero wages, and another for me as VenicePhotographer being related to employees of apulian_mariner (which I assume is my employee or something).In the problems section:- One problem involves Xadme having zero wages in his land_45.429697... which he might be aware of.- Another problem involves me (VenicePhotographer) and an employee called apulian_mariner being hungry, but this seems tied to my business or something.Let's parse the relationship data:The title field should describe our relationship based on \"We\" or \"They\".Since StrengthScore is 1.1/100, it means there's very little shared relevance. For example, in the description of mutual relevancies for Xadme to me: \"Mutual Relevancy Score: Very low (1.3) possibly because you haven't built a relationship or don't know about each other.\"In this case, StrengthScore is 1.1/100, so similarly very low.TrustScore is also low at 36.7/100.The description should be in first person from my perspective as VenicePhotographer.I am to respond with JSON only, no text before or after.Crafting the response:- Title: Something descriptive like \"Slight Business Acquaintance\"- Description: Use \"We\" or \"They\". Since I'm defining the relationship between us, and scores are low, it should reflect that there's minimal interaction.From the system prompt example, they use \"We have a...\" or similar phrasing in third person for \"they\", but it says to use \"We\" or \"They\" \u2013 probably means from my perspective, so I might say something like \"They [Xadme] and I [VenicePhotographer]...\"Let's read carefully: \"formulated with \\\"We\\\" or \\\"They\\\"\"In the example, they say \"They have proven...\" but it's described as our relationship.Best to use language from my perspective.But in JSON, title is a short description of the relationship between us.Given scores:StrengthScore 1.1/100 \u2248 almost no relevanceTrustScore 36.7/100 \u2248 low trust, suspicious or guarded.Also, from mutual relevancies: \"QualifiedAt\": indicates when it was qualified, but not much else.Perhaps our relationship is very weak; maybe we just met or have superficial interactions.In the context provided earlier in the system prompt:- I am VenicePhotographer with certain stats.- Xadme has high Ducats and Influence.But no specific details given about direct interaction except through this data point.To keep it authentic, since StrengthScore is low, emphasize that there's little to nothing between us.Possible JSON response structure:{\"title\": \"Minimal Professional Contact\",\"description\": \"As VenicePhotographer with Xadme, we share only the most basic business interactions due to our very limited relevance score of 1.1/100 and a somewhat guarded trust level at 36.7/100. This suggests our relationship is superficial or recently established without significant history.\"}But need to ensure it's accurate.From the system context in addSystem:- TrustScore: Slightly above neutral but still low- StrengthScore: Very low, almost non-existent relevanceAlso, mutual relevancies have score 1.1, which might be from a specific asset or something.In the relationship notes: \"Notes\": \"Sources: employee_fed, etc.\" \u2013 this could mean that we are connected through employees or business dealings, but with very weak strength.employee_fed and apulian_mariner \u2013 I think apulian_mariner is my employee (since in problem it's related to me).In the mutual relevancy for Xadme: \"asset\": building_45.444368... which is his Blacksmith, and assetType:building.For target citi zen (Xadme) relevant to me: It says \"Relevancies Target To Evaluator\" but I think that's the other way around; in this case, it's Xadme evaluating things related to me or something. Let's look at addSystem:The system prompt has two parts of mutual relevancies:- evaluator_to_target (VenicePhotographer to Xadme)- target_to_evaluator (Xadme to VenicePhotographer)In the response structure provided in the system prompt, it says for title and description.But I'm analyzing from my perspective as VenicePhotographer.Perhaps the relationship is bidirectional with low scores.To keep it simple: Since StrengthScore is very low (1.1/100), our connection is minimal. TrustScore 36.7 indicates some distrust or lack of confidence.Title could be \"Superficial Business Interaction\" or something similar.Description should detail using data.From the data:- We have a mutual relevancy with score 1.1, which might mean we're connected through business assets like buildings or employees.But I need to not invent facts; use what's given.So, base it on low scores and perhaps inferred from context that there's little trust or strength.Final response must be JSON only.</think>{  \"title\": \"Minimal Business Acquaintance\",  \"description\": \"As VenicePhotographer with Xadme, we share a very limited relevance score of approximately 1.1/100 and a distrustful trust level at 36.7/100, indicating our relationship is largely superficial or recently established without deep history.\"}",
