After all, Raffaele is a commoner from the lower class, so this greeting should reflect the social hierarchy between nobles and citizens.)(As a noble merchant in La Serenissima, I must use formal language appropriate for our status difference, but not seem too aloof. Although we are of different ranks, since Zuan has proactively addressed me as \"Noble,\" showing respect, my reply should be gracious yet convey the responsibility expected of nobles\u2014giving orders while allowing some latitude.)(I will say to Raffaele: Maintain a noble's commanding authority but with consideration for his lower status. This aligns with my identity and can guide him toward following my lead in this business venture. Alright, let's begin speaking to Zuan like this.)</think>Your Highness, it is an honor to meet you here at the inn on Calle della Misericordia. I have noted your arrival and am ready for instructions regarding our trade matters. Pray tell me what specific goods or ventures we should prioritize?",
