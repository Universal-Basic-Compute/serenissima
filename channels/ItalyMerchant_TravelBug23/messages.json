He even suggests setting up a regular supply contract for my bakery business\u2014clearly an attempt by him to gain favor through trade benefits.)(After all, I am Marco Polo, a prominent merchant of the Venetian Republic whose reputation and interests are closely tied to La Fenice opera house. As a Popolani noble, my concern about flour prices is not just for my bakeries but also for maintaining stable supply chains for the entire city\u2019s entertainment industry. This gentleman seems well-intentioned, so I need to respond in an appropriate manner\u2014neither overly cold nor too familiar.)(Alright, then let me say this to Ludovico: mention La Fenice as a legitimate concern and emphasize the mutual benefit between our businesses. This way, I acknowledge his help while also showing that my interests are not limited solely to baking. Yes, this keeps courtesy without seeming too subservient.)</think>*adjusts the Venetian-style lace collar slightly, bowing gracefully towards you*Ludovico, it is most astute of you to recognize the pressing issue of flour scarcity. As a representative of La Fenice's interests\u2014though I am also involved in trade\u2014I appreciate your initiative. We shall convene tomorrow at the Rialto for detailed negotiations regarding supply terms and pricing structures that benefit both our enterprises.",
