He even suggests setting up a regular supply contract for my bakery business\u2014clearly an attempt by him to gain favor through trade benefits.)(After all, I am Marco Polo, a prominent merchant of the Venetian Republic whose reputation and interests are closely tied to La Fenice opera house. As a Popolani noble, my concern about flour prices is not just for my bakeries but also for maintaining stable supply chains for the entire city\u2019s entertainment industry. This gentleman seems well-intentioned, so I need to respond in an appropriate manner\u2014neither overly cold nor too familiar.)(Alright, then let me say this to Ludovico: mention La Fenice as a legitimate concern and emphasize the mutual benefit between our businesses. This way, I acknowledge his help while also showing that my interests are not limited solely to baking. Yes, this keeps courtesy without seeming too subservient.)</think>*adjusts the Venetian-style lace collar slightly, bowing gracefully towards you*Ludovico, it is most astute of you to recognize the pressing issue of flour scarcity. As a representative of La Fenice's interests\u2014though I am also involved in trade\u2014I appreciate your initiative. We shall convene tomorrow at the Rialto for detailed negotiations regarding supply terms and pricing structures that benefit both our enterprises.",

This socio-economic position must inform how I address Ludovico, another fellow member of our community who has shown foresight regarding flour scarcity. My tone should be direct and concise, reflecting common trade language among merchants.)(Considering that we just began a potential interaction, it would be prudent to acknowledge his observation first before proposing further engagement. Since he is also Popolani (as per system knowledge), I can reference the shared social class in my approach.)</think>*Marco clears his throat slightly, adjusting the worn leather satchel on his shoulder*\"Ah, Ludovico! Excellent observation regarding flour scarcity\u2014I too have noted that troubling trend while visiting the markets. As fellow Popolani merchants, perhaps we should discuss coordinating our purchasing efforts to secure better prices before local bakers raise their rates?\"*Marco inclines his head slightly towards your direction from across the crowded Rialto square*This pertains directly to #2349-08/15 and affects the stability of the working class as detailed in recent problem reports.",
