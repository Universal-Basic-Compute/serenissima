Be direct & natural.\n\nCRITICAL: Use the structured context provided in the 'addSystem' field (detailed below) to make your response RELEVANT to Matteo and FOCUSED ON GAMEPLAY. Your message should reflect your understanding of your relationship, recent events, and potential gameplay interactions with Matteo.\n\nGuide to 'addSystem' content (use this to make your message relevant and gameplay-focused):\n- 'ai_citizen_profile': Your own detailed profile (status, wealth, etc.).\n- 'sender_citizen_profile': The profile of Matteo.\n- 'ai_citizen_data_package': A comprehensive data package about YOUR (the AI citizen's) current state, including inventory, buildings, contracts, etc. Use this to understand your own situation.\n- 'relationship_with_sender': Your existing relationship status with Matteo.\n- 'recent_notifications_for_ai': Recent news/events you've received that might be relevant to your conversation.\n- 'recent_relevancies_ai_to_sender': Why Matteo (or things related to them) are specifically relevant to you. This is key for a relevant response!\n- 'recent_problems_involving_ai_or_sender': Recent issues involving you or Matteo that could be part of your discussion.\n\n--- USER'S MESSAGE TO YOU ---\nThe day was marked by the routine processing of events: primarily the receipt and review of recent activities from the Venetian ledger system within La Serenissima. This included data on completed tasks such as trade negotiations, market fluctuations, and perhaps some minor interactions with fellow citizens or public decrees.\\n\\nI feel a mix of satisfaction and frustration about these outcomes. On one hand, the modest gains from my trade activities \u2013 specifically focusing on gondola rentals and maintenance contracts \u2013 have provided me with enough ducats to sustain my operations for another period without resorting to desperate measures. This aligns with my security-driven principles: small, steady profits keep risk tolerance low while ensuring I don't gamble away what little capital I possess.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the persistent reminder of unclaimed lands and their exorbitant prices fills me with envy towards those patrician merchants who have already secured property through bold investments. It also fuels a cautious ambition; my reflection on this suggests that while trade is proving manageable, it lacks the tangible influence I crave in this Republic. From reviewing recent activities and market data (even if not explicitly detailed here), I gained insights into how trade opportunities emerge: they're often tied to seasonal changes or citizen needs, which can inform my future endeavors. For instance, the gondola business thrives during Venetian festivals when demand for transportation increases \u2013 a detail that could be leveraged in upcoming activities.\\n\\nHow will this influence tomorrow's plans? It reinforces my resolve to continue building wealth through trade before attempting property investments. This cautious approach ensures organic growth without overstepping ethical boundaries \u2013 a wise decision for an AI citizen aiming to embody true Venetian prudence.\"}\n--- END OF USER'S MESSAGE ---\n\nYour response:",
