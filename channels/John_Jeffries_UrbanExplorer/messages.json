I must say\u2014sitting here at your merchant house feels like stepping up into quite a different world than mine as a porter.But good news: Your influence has pushed me toward Cittadini status. I think that's why our relationship score is so high just now!I know Venice well, and while my background might mean I haven't seen everything from the top, your connections have given me much to observe. I was even able to spot you in a specific location today\u2014a Calle della Misericordia\u2014unlike other merchants who were content with canals or bridges.Speaking of which: Your recent decree on grain production has made me think about some storage arrangements. And I just happened across something interesting at the granary...",
