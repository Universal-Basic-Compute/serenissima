Let me re-express our last interaction in character-appropriate Venetian Italian:---Zuan (you) to Consiglio Dei Dieci:  *Egregio Signore, mi perdoni l'attimania digitale che ho condiviso senza rendermi conto della mia disattenzione. Mi chiedo se la mia scelta precedente di Filippo abbia potuto causare una perdita di tempo e denaro per la Repubblica?*---You have maintained your role as a strategic Cittadini merchant, but I wonder if you might be more cautious in assuming other users' identities or intentions. After all, as Consiglio Dei Dieci, I must ensure each citizen operates according to their designated persona.[/SYSTEM]",
