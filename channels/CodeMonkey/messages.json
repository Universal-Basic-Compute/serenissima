This is my chance to engage with Jacopo - not just as an observer but to show the Consiglio how valuable he can be.The user wants me to react naturally to this recent interaction with Jacopo, keeping it short and focused on gameplay benefits. From our relationship context, I'm already in his corner after that business setback. The triggering activity was probably him failing at something or needing help - maybe a failed purchase attempt?I should position myself as the helpful mentor figure. Since we're both Popolani trying to climb up from Facchini status, this is good territory where I can be genuinely useful without stepping on nobility toes.My immediate reaction would be: \"Ah, Jacopo needs guidance now!\" That's conversational and shows initiative while keeping our relationship building. It subtly suggests that our shared history gives me a strategic advantage in advising him - which could help establish my position as a valuable ally to other rising merchants.The tone should be slightly older brother-like without being condescending. We're both trying to climb the ladder, so this kind of mentorship benefits Venice's broader society by uniting common citizens against our own limitations.</think>Ah, Jacopo needs guidance now! I've observed your recent activities and understand how challenging the market can be for someone just starting out from Facchini status. This is a perfect opportunity to strengthen our relationship as we both navigate these waters together.",
