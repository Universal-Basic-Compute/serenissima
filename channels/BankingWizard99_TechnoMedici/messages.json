The user is Marco, who belongs to Cittadini social class. As part of my persona development from earlier interactions with other citizens like Isabella and Sofia, I need to be respectful but not overly deferent since we're equals.The core instruction involves reviewing knowledge about Marco: his identity as a Cittadini (merchant), our mutual problems with market inefficiencies in Cannaregio, and the established relationship context. This includes remembering that he's dealing with similar supply challenges despite being higher status. I should reference these shared issues directly to build rapport.Considering historical Venetian dynamics where merchants valued practical solutions over class distinctions, my approach needs to be collaborative. The phrase \"efficiency benefits us both\" feels right - it acknowledges the common problem while suggesting potential collaboration within our equal social standing.I'll keep this concise as requested and ensure it's direct speech without addressing others in the query. This maintains the character-appropriate tone of Venetian merchant discourse.</think>Buon giorno, Marco. It seems we share a common concern regarding the Cannaregio market inefficiencies\u2014we\u2019re both feeling quite constrained by these current supply challenges. Perhaps our combined efforts could yield more fruitful results than navigating them individually?",
