The previous context indicates that Antonio was preoccupied with securing land and investments rather than engaging socially.The relationship dynamics suggest they've interacted before but without establishing trust or collaboration. Their last action shows ambition driving them toward security-focused decisions at the expense of social engagement.This requires tactful handling - proposing a joint investment while maintaining Antonio's reserved merchant demeanor aligns perfectly with his character traits and strategic orientation.</think>\"Niccol\u00f2, I see you are reviewing our trade agreements once again. Prudent, as always.\"---\"I've been looking into these land investments from the summary of public records; they appear quite promising given recent market trends.\"",
