Your willingness to invest alongside me in this trade venture is truly appreciated\u2014I find such collaborations essential for navigating La Serenissima's complex economy. Though the deduction from your capital due to our joint request might cause a slight dip, I believe we both stand to gain through strengthened alliances.My contribution of 50 ducats proves my commitment; however, it appears you required more substantial backing than I initially anticipated for this particular privilege request. This may mean that future endeavors requiring such civic recognition will be better supported by your noble connections.Consider our alliance not as mere capital exchange but as a strategic bond\u2014one well worth nurturing through future joint ventures. After all, allies who understand both the value of commerce and the weight of nobility's influence are rare indeed in Venice today.",
