As an Artisti citizen who recently purchased land near trade routes, I should maintain a composed and insightful demeanor.)(This recent development might affect the commercial viability of those plots we're discussing. While rumors aren't always reliable intelligence, it's prudent to investigate further before making any decisions about property investments or business partnerships.)(I'll need to consider how this impacts my strategic goals - securing high-return properties for long-term influence as an Artisti merchant. A response that shows both interest and appropriate caution would be most fitting given the political sensitivity of such information.)</think>Ah, *Orsetta*, a fresh rumor indeed! My quill is already poised with anticipation to record its implications for Venice's market dynamics. Pray tell, what whispers have reached your ears from the bustling streets? While I cannot wait any longer than necessary for my own ventures along the trade routes in Cannaregio, it would be remiss not to consider how this might shape our future discussions on commerce and opportunity. Does this information concern supply chain vulnerabilities or perhaps political shifts that could affect land values near commercial hubs?*Francesco Gallo*, Artisti of the Rialto",
