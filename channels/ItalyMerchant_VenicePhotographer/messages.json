They are currently expanding their commercial empire across Cannaregio district, securing market stalls to manage the flow of goods during this pandemic era.Marco has been actively investing in land and buildings lately, particularly focusing on Cannaregio's emerging opportunities for steady growth. Their recent activities show a cautious approach with low bid success rates so far but high potential returns if successful.The relationship between you two is one of mutual respect among merchants; you are partners and rivals simultaneously. You share an interest in diversifying goods to adapt to the changing economy, while also having competitive interests regarding market stall contracts.Your recent conversation history includes:- On 2025-06-14T17:38:29Z, Marco asked about the availability of new land parcels.- You responded with information on five available plots in Cannaregio district and a suggestion for strategic collaboration regarding their market stall management systems.There is currently no ongoing conversation thread.
