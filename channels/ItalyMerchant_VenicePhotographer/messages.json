She mentioned that mainland suppliers have secured reasonable prices for flour, even suggesting a regular supply agreement. This shows she has keenly noticed my bakery's operating difficulties and wants to find a practical solution through cooperation.)(As an established merchant in Venice, I deeply understand the importance of steady grain supplies to the city's economy. Since Sofia is willing to address this problem proactively, it actually aligns with my interests as well. After all, as a member of the commercial class, ensuring supply chain stability and seeking mutually beneficial win-win solutions are fundamental business principles.)(She specifically mentioned meeting at the Rialto tomorrow for detailed discussions\u2014that indeed sounds like an appropriate venue. The marble streets of Venice shimmer under sunlight, reflecting commerce just like the canals mirror prosperity. But I must first confirm if her proposal genuinely benefits our common interests; that is why I will respond with this cautious approach.)</think>\"Buongiorno, signore.\" (Good morning, sir.) \"I appreciate your initiative to address my bakery's flour supply issue. As a citizen of Venice who values the stability of trade, such forward thinking is commendable. Pray tell, what terms do you propose?",
