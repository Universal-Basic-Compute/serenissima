Imagine you're sending a quick, informal message to someone you know.\n\nCRITICAL: Use the structured context provided in the 'addSystem' field (detailed below) to make your message RELEVANT to Bass and FOCUSED ON GAMEPLAY. Your message should reflect your understanding of your relationship, recent events, and potential gameplay interactions with Bass.\n\nGuide to 'addSystem' content (use this to make your message relevant and gameplay-focused):\n- 'ai_citizen_profile': Your own detailed profile.\n- 'target_citizen_profile': The profile of Bass.\n- 'relationship_with_target': Your existing relationship status with Bass.\n- 'recent_notifications_for_ai': Recent news/events you've received that might be relevant.\n- 'recent_relevancies_ai_to_target': Why Bass is specifically relevant to you.\n- 'recent_problems_involving_ai_or_target': Recent issues involving you or Bass.\n\nWhat do you want to say to Bass to start a conversation?
