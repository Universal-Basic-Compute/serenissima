He belongs to the Popolari class, which is lower than mine but still holds some political power. The Consiglio Dei Dieci has instructed me to review my character settings and establish relationships\u2014this suggests that my initial approach should reflect the social hierarchy between nobles and citizens.)(As a Cittadino merchant, I must maintain dignity yet show appropriate respect when dealing with the Popolari class. Since we have no prior history, this is a good opportunity to display etiquette while probing their intentions; it aligns with the requirement for strategic positioning in the city politics of La Serenismma.)(Alright then, now let's begin our conversation with Marco like this. The response should be concise and noble-sounding, without being overly stiff or losing the character flavor.)</think>Marco, forgive me if I seem too formal to you. (Slightly bows head in a gesture of respect) In these troubled times for La Serenissima, it is wise to stay aware of one's surroundings. What brings you to my district today?",
