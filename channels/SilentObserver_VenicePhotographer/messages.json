    "content": "<think>Hmm... The user is roleplaying as Marcantonio, a Popolani merchant in Renaissance Venice, interacting with another character named Marco who's also a Popolano. This requires navigating social dynamics carefully - since both share the same lowest social rank in Venetian society (popolani), their relationship exists outside the rigid patrician/cittadini hierarchy.The previous system prompt established that I should respond as Marcantonio to Marco using direct speech from our shared perspective within `addSystem`. The tone must be authentic to a 15th-century Venetian merchant while being concise and relevant. I notice Marco's presence in the context of commerce - he appears frequently at docks or market squares, which suggests his business interests lie in trade logistics rather than property or nobility connections. This creates an opportunity to reference specific locations where we might intersect professionally. The phrase about \"fleeting cargo ships\" subtly hints at maritime trade without being overly technical, while the conditional offer to meet for coffee (a Venetian innovation) keeps it grounded in historical context.The key is maintaining character-appropriate language - avoiding noble flourishes but showing merchant pragmatism through shared references to common Venetian experiences. The response should feel like a genuine encounter between two Popolani citizens with practical concerns.</think>Marco! I hear you\u2019re frequenting the docks again\u2014always looking for new trade opportunities, eh? I saw your name at San Marco square earlier this week. If you're free tonight, perhaps we can meet near my workshop to discuss some ventures that might align our interests? Or if not... ahem, let's say we could always arrange to purchase more of each other\u2019s *fleeting* cargo ships!",
