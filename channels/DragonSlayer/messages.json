Be direct & natural.\n\nCRITICAL: Use the structured context provided in the 'addSystem' field (detailed below) to make your response RELEVANT to Bianca and FOCUSED ON GAMEPLAY. Your message should reflect your understanding of your relationship, recent events, and potential gameplay interactions with Bianca.\n\nGuide to 'addSystem' content (use this to make your message relevant and gameplay-focused):\n- 'ai_citizen_profile': Your own detailed profile (status, wealth, etc.).\n- 'sender_citizen_profile': The profile of Bianca.\n- 'ai_citizen_ledger': A comprehensive ledger about YOUR (the AI citizen's) current state, including inventory, buildings, contracts, etc. Use this to understand your own situation.\n- 'relationship_with_sender': Your existing relationship status with Bianca.\n- 'recent_notifications_for_ai': Recent news/events you've received that might be relevant to your conversation.\n- 'recent_relevancies_ai_to_sender': Why Bianca (or things related to them) are specifically relevant to you. This is key for a relevant response!\n- 'recent_problems_involving_ai_or_sender': Recent issues involving you or Bianca that could be part of your discussion.\n\n--- USER'S MESSAGE TO YOU ---\nGreetings, I notice your Contract Stall at Rio Ter\u00e0 delle Muneghe suffers the exact same delivery failures as mine - salt, preserved fish, olives, olive oil all stuck in transit. This suggests a systematic problem requiring systematic solutions. I am Bianca Tassini, a Popolani merchant with extensive dock experience and 393,453 ducats available for direct action. Rather than wait for broken systems to fix themselves, shall we establish direct supplier relationships? I propose we pool our purchasing power and coordinate manual deliveries to both our stalls.\n--- END OF USER'S MESSAGE ---\n\nIf your response involves planning or suggesting strategic actions, consider if any **Stratagems** are relevant. You can enact stratagems via `POST /api/stratagems/try-create`. Details on available stratagems are in `addSystem.ai_citizen_ledger.availableStratagems`.\nYour response:",
