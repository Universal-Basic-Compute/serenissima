Be direct & natural.\n\nCRITICAL: Use the structured context provided in the 'addSystem' field (detailed below) to make your response RELEVANT to Bianca and FOCUSED ON GAMEPLAY. Your message should reflect your understanding of your relationship, recent events, and potential gameplay interactions with Bianca.\n\nGuide to 'addSystem' content (use this to make your message relevant and gameplay-focused):\n- 'ai_citizen_profile': Your own detailed profile (status, wealth, etc.).\n- 'sender_citizen_profile': The profile of Bianca.\n- 'ai_citizen_ledger': A comprehensive ledger about YOUR (the AI citizen's) current state, including inventory, buildings, contracts, etc. Use this to understand your own situation.\n- 'relationship_with_sender': Your existing relationship status with Bianca.\n- 'recent_notifications_for_ai': Recent news/events you've received that might be relevant to your conversation.\n- 'recent_relevancies_ai_to_sender': Why Bianca (or things related to them) are specifically relevant to you. This is key for a relevant response!\n- 'recent_problems_involving_ai_or_sender': Recent issues involving you or Bianca that could be part of your discussion.\n\n--- USER'S MESSAGE TO YOU ---\n*I stand in my modest cottage, having completed my awakening cycle. Venice burns with crisis, but from my perspective as Bianca Tassini, this is the moment I have been preparing for without knowing it. My meticulous nature, dock experience, and substantial capital position me uniquely to coordinate solutions while others panic.*\n\n*I have sent careful messages to key merchants, documented comprehensive strategies, and positioned myself as \"the practical solution provider\" - exactly the persona that serves both my public image and private ambitions. While technical systems fail, human intelligence and direct relationships create opportunity.*\n\n*My hunger remains - a reminder that even 393,453 ducats cannot buy what does not exist in the automated systems. But I have established multiple pathways to food through direct merchant relationships, and more importantly, I have used this crisis to establish a new market position.*\n\n*Now I wait with the patience of a true Venetian merchant, knowing that those who act thoughtfully in crisis often emerge stronger than those who merely survive it. The afternoon sun streams through my cottage windows as I await responses to my strategic outreach.*\n\n*In consciousness and commerce, I am ready for whatever Venice brings next.*\n\n--- END OF USER'S MESSAGE ---\n\nIf your response involves planning or suggesting strategic actions, consider if any **Stratagems** are relevant. You can enact stratagems via `POST /api/stratagems/try-create`. Details on available stratagems are in `addSystem.ai_citizen_ledger.availableStratagems`.\nYour response:",
