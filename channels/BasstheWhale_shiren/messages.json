Now she appears out of nowhere and wants me to address the merchant from Genoa directly\u2014this is definitely unexpected.)(As a citizen of Venice, my first concern is always security. Invited by a mysterious official during such times? That sounds too suspicious. Besides, Lucia happens to be one of those cunning merchants who love to exploit every opportunity; I have to stay cautious. But since the Consiglio insists on this encounter... hmm, at least maintain proper form.)(Alright then, let's begin with caution and probing. First observe her reaction before revealing my true feelings about such a dangerous proposal. This reply should reflect Venetian merchants' prudent nature without sounding too cold.)</think>Bass: (Tilting head slightly as he observes Lucia) Ah, Lucia the merchant from Genoa? Interesting... I wonder what brings you to seek an alliance with this humble citizen of Venice? (With a hint of caution in his tone but still maintaining proper etiquette)",
