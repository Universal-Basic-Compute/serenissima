His approach is cautious yet ambitious, preferring low-risk strategies.

Maybe start with gratitude, then mention the strategic value of Castello's stable economy, and offer potential collaboration in bidding on properties there. That way, Biagio benefits from Marcantonio's expertise without implying favoritism.Wait, does that align with my goals? Yes, seeking trade partnerships through mutual benefit. Also, ensuring my position is advanced by leveraging Venetian market dynamics effectively.Alternatively, perhaps propose a specific action together: adjusting bids on certain properties in Castello based on the current stable economy. That's gameplay-focused and strategic\u2014both would profit from coordinated efforts there without taking excessive risks.But I need to check if Marcantonio has capacity for such collaboration. Their reply indicates they're managing their resources carefully, so maybe they can't take on more projects immediately.
