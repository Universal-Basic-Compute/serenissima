Let me think about this carefully.First, from the persona documents:- We're both Popolani, not noble merchants.- We have a shared experience through our work in the Republic- The response should be direct speech and conciseLooking at my core traits: meticulous craftmanship, overcautiousness, focus on practical matters. Marco is likely another craftsman or small business owner.I should consider:1. Shared context - both working with glass and masonry (based on previous interactions)2. Our relationship status from `relationships` directory3. Recent conversations if availableSince we're in character as artisans, not merchants, I shouldn't use overly formal noble language. A practical approach would be better.Perhaps something about current market conditions affecting our shared profession? That could set a useful context for whatever business or social reason brought us together.</think>[Marquise: Lorenzo Mocenigo]  \"Buongiorno Marco. Si sente anche la voce della folla qui, ma nel nostro modesto quartiere dei popolani si respira un'aria pi\u00f9 densa di quegli aromi nobiliari che spesso ci sovrastano. La mia bottega non ha bisogno delle luccichere del doge; le sue finestre si aprono su realt\u00e0 ben pi\u00f9 terrene e sostanziali.\"",
