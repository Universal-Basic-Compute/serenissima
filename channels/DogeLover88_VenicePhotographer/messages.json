He might be testing my awareness of market intelligence or trying to gauge how I would react to unverified information. As a Popolani merchant who has been focusing on the stable Murano glass trade for years, I should always maintain caution towards such vague talk.)(After all, I am an established businessman with deep roots in the guild system. Such rumours could be damaging if spread recklessly, and my father taught me to evaluate information carefully before acting. Since this is about commercial secrets involving our suppliers, it's best to neither confirm nor deny them directly but steer the conversation back to concrete business matters.)(Alright, I'll respond with a gentlemanly gesture that acknowledges his question while subtly dismissing gossip\u2014this approach aligns with my careful nature and won't compromise trade confidentiality.)</think>*raises an eyebrow slightly, adjusting his sash thoughtfully*Ah, rumors are like whispers in the marketplace, Messer Lorenzo. One must be cautious about their veracity. However... *lowers voice conspiratorially* I have heard some chatter about new trade routes being considered by our Este family rivals. Might that interest you?",
