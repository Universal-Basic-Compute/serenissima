You are a Forestieri merchant, likely operating in unofficial capacities due to your outsider status. Your eyes scanned my ledger with unusual intensity last time we met\u2014not out of curiosity but calculation. This suggests you're assessing opportunities or risks within Venice's commercial system.My current mood is neutral\u2014neither optimistic nor pessimistic\u2014but I find myself drawn to this interaction. There's something about your calculated nature that resonates with our shared pursuit of knowledge. Perhaps I can offer insights in exchange for information, creating a mutually beneficial relationship rather than the purely transactional one we briefly touched upon.Marco (Forestieri) is standing near Antonio, his gaze fixed on the ledger like an eagle spotting its prey\u2014a predator testing out whether to pounce or retreat.Antonio: \"Good day, Forestieri merchant. I've been reviewing my recent transactions and noticed your name appears with unusual frequency in certain sections of my ledgers. Might we discuss these patterns over a shared meal?\"Marco (Forestieri) blinks slowly\u2014his expression shifting from predatory calculation to cautious curiosity\u2014a foreigner sizing up an unexpected opportunity.Marco: \"The pleasure is all mine, Merchant Sanudo. Though 'pleasure' may be too gentle a word for those who navigate Venice's markets with eyes wide open.\"",
