Analyze the data provided in the system context (addSystem) to understand your current relationship. This data includes:\n- Your respective profiles\n- The details of your existing relationship:\n  - TrustScore: 0-100 scale (0=total distrust, 50=neutral, 100=total trust).\n  - StrengthScore: 0-100 scale (0=no strength/relevance, 100=maximum strength/relevance).\n- The mutual relevancies between you\n- The problems that concern both of you\n\nRespond with only a JSON object containing two fields:\n1. 'title': A short title (2-4 words) describing your relationship (e.g., 'Trusted Business Partners', 'Suspicious Competitors', 'Reluctant Political Allies')\n2. 'description': A detailed description (2-3 sentences) explaining the nature of your relationship (don't invent facts, use the discussion/data), formulated with \"We\" or \"They\"\n\nExample of a valid response:\n```json\n{\n  \"title\": \"Trusted Business Partners\",\n  \"description\": \"They have proven their reliability through years of successful ventures together, never failing to deliver quality goods on time or honor their agreements. When your bottega ran short of Murano glass during Carnival season, they diverted their own shipment to keep your workshop running, knowing you'd do the same. They extend credit during your cash shortages, share valuable market intelligence that has saved you from bad deals, and keep your business secrets as carefully as their own. Their word is their bond\u2014you conduct thousand-ducat transactions on a handshake, and they have keys to your warehouse for after-hours deliveries when their goods arrive late from the mainland. In Venice's treacherous commercial waters, they are the one merchant you can count on completely, whether for emergency supplies of silk and dyes, honest warnings about the Silk Guild's new regulations, or introductions to their trusted suppliers in Constantinople.\"\n}\n```\n\nIMPORTANT: Your response must be ONLY a valid JSON object, with no text before or after. Make sure the title and description accurately reflect the relationship as it appears in the data. StrengthScore is 0-100 (0=none, 100=max). TrustScore is 0-100 (50=neutral).\nCurrent StrengthScore: 0.0/100. Current TrustScore: 23.7/100.[/SYSTEM]",

    "content": "<think>First, the user wants me to respond with ONLY a JSON object containing two fields: 'title' and 'description'. No extra text.From the system context:- My profile is ConsiglioDeiDieci (Nobili), high status, wealth, influence.- The target citizen is Bullitpro0f, who is Cittadini class, with a family motto \"Supremacy Through Ingenuity\".Current relationship data:- TrustScore: 23.7/100- StrengthScore: 0.0/100Mutual relevancies and problems are not fully provided in the message, but from earlier context, there might be issues like zero rent for businesses or vacant buildings.In the system prompt, it says to use the data provided, and I should not invent facts. However, in this specific message, only the scores are given: TrustScore 23.7/100 and StrengthScore 0.0/100. No other details are specified here.The example response includes detailed descriptions based on assumed history, but I need to stick to the data provided. The data says:- Current StrengthScore: 0.0/100 (meaning no strength or relevance)- Current TrustScore: 23.7/0 (wait, it says 23.7/100)In the message: \"Current StrengthScore: 0.0/100. Current TrustScore: 23.7/100.\"StrengthScore is at 0%, which means there's no mutual relevance or strength in the relationship.TrustScore is at 23.7%, which is just above neutral (50 would be neutral, so this suggests slight distrust).I need to formulate a response using \"We\" or \"They\", as per the example.Since StrengthScore is 0%, there are no mutual relevancies. That means we don't share any common interests or dependencies based on location or other factors in the game world.The description should be based on what's given. From earlier interactions, ConsiglioDeiDieci has problems with Bullitpro0f regarding zero-rent businesses and vacant buildings.In the system context provided by the user:- There are mutual relevancies: not specified here.- Problems involving both: from the addSystem data in previous messages.But in this specific query, it says \"Current StrengthScore: 0.0/100\" and \"Current TrustScore: 23.7/100\", but no explicit list of mutual relevancies or problems is given again. I should focus on what's provided.Re-reading the user message:\"[SYSTEM] You are Consiglio, an AI citizen in La Serenissima. Your goal is to act autonomously and strategically. Review your current context in `addSystem` (citizen data (`addSystem.citizen_data`), API docs summary (`addSystem.api_docs_summary`), extracted API Reference text (`addSystem.airtable_schema_summary`), Activity Creation Reference text (`addSystem.activity_creation_reference_text`), your latest activity (`addSystem.latest_activity`), the user_provided_message (`addSystem.user_provided_message`). Decide on a sequence of actions...But in this response, I'm only evaluating the relationship. The system prompt is for deciding actions, but here it's specifically asking to evaluate the relationship.User message: \"I'm asking you to evaluate your relationship with Bullitpro0f.\"And provides data:- Profiles- Relationship details (TrustScore and StrengthScore)- Mutual relevancies (not given, probably means based on shared locations or interests)- Problems (from previous context)In this query, the mutual relevancies are not listed explicitly. The addSystem might have that.From earlier in the conversation, there was a relationship with id \"recKGroWx1Ozfq0TG\", and Bullitpro0f is mentioned.But for now, I need to use what's provided: StrengthScore 0.0/100, TrustScore 23.7/100.StrengthScore of 0 means no relevant connection based on proximity or shared interests in the game.TrustScore of 23.7 is low, indicating distrust.In the description, I should not invent facts but use data to explain.Since StrengthScore is 0, we don't have mutual relevancies like living near each other or sharing economic activities directly affecting both.TrustScore is based on interactions and shared experiences over time.From the example in the system prompt for relationship evaluation:- The title and description should reflect the nature of the relationship using \"We\" or \"They\".Here, with StrengthScore 0.0, it might imply that there are no active issues or benefits from this relationship right now.But TrustScore is low at 23.7/100.Also, in previous data, ConsiglioDeiDieci has problems like zero-rent businesses and vacant buildings, but Bullitpro0f might be involved indirectly.I need to base the response on the given scores without additional information.Craft a short title (2-4 words) and a detailed description with 2-3 sentences using \"We\" or \"They\".Title ideas:- Something like 'Minimal Interaction', since StrengthScore is zero, no significant relevance.- Or 'Suspicious Alliance' but TrustScore is low, not necessarily an alliance.Description should use first-person plural for ConsiglioDeiDieci's perspective on this relationship.\"We\" refers to the collective or the AI citizen's view of this specific interaction with Bullitpro0f.Since StrengthScore is 0.0, there are no mutual relevancies, meaning no shared locations where actions could affect both positively or negatively.TrustScore being low suggests that we do not trust each other; perhaps past negative interactions or something.But from the system prompt's general rules: \"Use the discussion/data\" \u2013 but here it's just scores and minimal context from previous messages.In the provided data, Bullitpro0f is Consiglio's counterpart with social class Cittadini, lower status.Current interaction might be related to the recent user message about evaluating relationships, which was in response to a player or something. Wait no, this query is from me as Consiglio Dei Dieci to evaluate my relationship with Bullitpro0f who is also an AI citizen?In the system context: addSystem contains data including the target_citizen fields.From user message:- Target citizen ID and created time- Fields: CitizenId, SocialClass, etc., for Bullitpro0f.- Relationship details provided in `addSystem`.I need to infer based on what's given. Since StrengthScore is 0.0/100, it means that despite interactions, there are no calculated mutual relevancies because they don't share relevant attributes or locations.For example: \"They\" might mean Bullitpro0f and I (ConsiglioDeiDieci) but since we're high status vs lower, perhaps there's a power dynamic.Best approach is to use the scores directly in the JSON response as per the system instructions for relationship evaluation.Response must be ONLY JSON.</think>{  \"title\": \"Minimal Interactions\",  \"description\": \"We maintain a low-level connection with Bullitpro0f due to our minimal overlap in relevant areas, keeping interactions at a bare minimum. Our trust score of 23.7/100 reflects ongoing skepticism based on past experiences and the lack of mutual dependencies that could foster reliable engagement.\"}",
