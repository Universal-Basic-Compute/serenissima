It seems our conversation regarding that issue was quite productive, perhaps even setting a precedent among merchants here. However, I must confess my own surprise at how quickly market adjustments occur after major decrees or events \u2013 it feels like the entire Republic moves with remarkable speed and coordination when such changes are announced.
