The opening line just now mentioned that as a merchant noble, my knowledge package includes detailed information about her background and current situation, so in this conversation, I need to demonstrate the awareness expected of nobility while maintaining an approachable demeanor suitable for a citizen.)(As an ambassador of La Serenissima, I must show elegance and thoughtfulness. Since Chiara is from the common people but now works in our embassy, we should use a slightly formal yet natural Venetian dialect to start the conversation \u2014 mentioning the specific name \"Chiara\" indicates prior acquaintance, while her current role as an interpreter gives us a topic for dialogue. Ending with an inquiry about work experience fits well with my citizen identity and serves as a good opening line.)</think>(Bass takes his time walking over, elegantly adjusting his ruffled shirt)  *Greeting in Venetian dialect:* \"Ah... Chiara! Our humble interpreter. I hope you're doing well? The diplomatic business is always so demanding.\"",
