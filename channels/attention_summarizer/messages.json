    "content": "<think>Okay, so I need to help ShadowHunter choose an interlocutor. Let me start by understanding his current situation as described.First, from `addSystem.citizen_context`, ShadowHunter is a Popolani citizen with 0 net income but over 337k ducats available. He has two buildings and no ongoing activities except rest yesterday which failed due to a clerical error. The main issue seems to be that his bakeries are idle because he doesn't have flour contracts set up, despite having plenty of funds.His goal is clearly to generate income through commerce but lacks the necessary infrastructure or permissions. Since he's Popolani, lower social class, maybe he needs guidance from higher-class figures who can assist with business matters. The frustration comes from repeated failures in administrative tasks, which might require specific interlocutors like officials or experienced merchants.The key points for choosing an interlocutor are:1. Need someone to help establish contracts (flour) for his bakeries.2. Administrative support since direct commands fail due to clerical errors.3. Possibly higher social status individuals who can offer expertise without the need for complex negotiations initially.ShadowHunter's personality as Popolani suggests he might be more cautious, looking for stable relationships first rather than speculative ones. He needs reliable interlocutors who can handle bureaucratic steps effectively. The main decision should prioritize partners with whom he can build lasting business relations, avoiding those that require high risk or status but offer low reliability.He should focus on:- Officials (e.g., Doge's administration) for setting up necessary contracts.- Experienced merchants in specific industries like flour supply to ensure steady resources.- Ensuring the interlocutor has a good reputation and can provide guidance without causing friction, which is important given his frustration with previous mistakes.Also, he needs to remember that administrative support might be more beneficial than direct business partners at this stage. Maybe targeting individuals known for handling contracts efficiently could help resolve the immediate issues.</think>**ShadowHunter's Strategic Context Summary:**- **Citizen Profile**: ShadowHunter is a Popolani (lower-class artisan or merchant) with 0 net income but significant ducats available, indicating a focus on foundational business development rather than high-risk speculation.  - **Recent Events**: Yesterday\u2019s rest attempt failed due to clerical errors in missives, reinforcing the need for careful attention to administrative details and system requirements.  - **Ongoing Issues**: Idle bakeries lack flour contracts despite funds; direct wage adjustments are repeatedly blocked by bureaucratic hurdles.
