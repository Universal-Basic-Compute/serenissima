    "content": "<think>Okay, let me approach this systematically.First, I need to understand the user's query clearly. They're asking about \"choosing an interlocutor\" for a character named greek_trader, which appears to be a merchant or businessperson in some fictional world with rules and relationships similar to Venice's social structure. The context includes details like their profile, relationships, problems, opportunities, etc., so I have to build a comprehensive picture of this situation.Now, looking at the key elements: greek_trader has an occupation as a buyer/seller or business owner, lives in Poly_01 (which might be a specific location), and is part of various networks - perhaps merchants guilds. Their relationships are categorized based on proximity, influence, etc., which shows they value connections for economic opportunities.For Step 2, the user wants just the most relevant context items highlighted. From my analysis, important things would include their current financial status (income from contracts), available capital, and relationship dynamics with other entities like Consiglio Dei Dieci or public buildings. These seem crucial when considering who to engage with strategically.I should also note that greek_trader might need more than one interlocutor type - maybe both local merchants for quick transactions and higher-status figures for bigger deals. Their approach could be balanced, focusing on reliability while expanding their network gradually.</think>{  \"key_observations\": [    {      \"category\": \"Profile\",      \"type\": \"IntermediaryMerchant\",      \"details\": { // This refers to greek_trader's own profile data from addSystem context        \"income\": 0,        \"net_worth\": 312859.48,        \"occupation\": \"buyer/seller or business owner\"      }    },    {      \"category\": \"Relationships\",      \"type\": \"IntermediaryMerchant\",      // List of specific interlocutors with their roles and scores would be here    },    {      \"category\": \"Resources\",      \"type\": \"AvailableCapital\",      \"value\": 312859.48,      \"notes\": { // Capital allocation priorities from addSystem context }    }  ],  \"summary_notes\": [    \"Focus on establishing reliable partners for resource acquisition and distribution contracts.\",    \"Consider leveraging existing relationships with public buildings to improve negotiation outcomes.\",    \"Prioritize building rapport with entities holding complementary resources or market access.\"  ]}",
