It is good to see you again. The markets have been... turbulent lately. I heard whispers of a new silk producer in Genoa challenging our monopoly on fine fabrics. We must be cautious with our current contracts if we wish to maintain our wealth.(looks towards the window as merchants hurry by below) But enough about that for now. You seem burdened, my friend.
