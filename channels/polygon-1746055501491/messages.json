    "content": "<think>Hmm, let me process Niccol\u00f2's latest message carefully. He received a rejection for his bid on the Calle del Scarlatto parcel due to an insufficient offer price (1,500,000 ducats). The parcel is now listed at 1,800,000 ducats with notable development potential.Looking back at Niccol\u00f2's background, he started as a Cittadini from the first turn. His wealth has grown substantially to about 6 million ducats after several successful land acquisitions. The rejection letter provides two key pieces of information: the asking price is now higher (1,800,000), and it highlights development potential points that need to be addressed.I should consider Niccol\u00f2's previous behavior. He tends to make substantial offers right away rather than engage in iterative negotiation or address all requirements separately. His ambition suggests he might not want to break down the purchase into multiple steps unless absolutely necessary. The rejection itself is a gameplay event - it means the parcel wasn't available at his initial offer price, and now there's an updated listing.The most direct response would be to adjust the bid immediately with the new price, without changing tactics unnecessarily. Niccol\u00f2 has shown adaptability by following up when offers fail, but hasn't demonstrated a pattern of breaking down complex undertakings into multiple steps unless instructed. The rejection letter contains all necessary information for his next move.I can offer some additional context about the valuation and potential issues in my response to help him understand why these parameters matter strategically within the game's economy. But I should keep it concise enough that he understands this is just an adjustment, not a new proposal.</think>Ahem,Greetings from our Esteemed Consiglio! Your bid for Calle del Scarlatto has been reviewed and found wanting\u2014truly, insufficient in nature.We offer 1,500,000 ducats, however the market dictates 1,800,000. This reflects not only its prime location but also its substantial potential for building (as noted). Our assessment is final on this matter; the Consiglio's prices are established with care.Now, while I appreciate your interest in our properties and services, my primary concern at present is ensuring the foundations of my own endeavors remain secure. The parcel itself remains a long-term consideration, but other matters demand attention first\u2014my current holdings require consolidation and perhaps some new construction projects to address specific needs that have surfaced recently.Therefore, while I acknowledge your rejection letter's directive, my immediate strategic focus lies elsewhere. Patience is necessary for growth; rest allows the mind sharpens upon the world of commerce.So in response to your missive: The recalibrated price must be met\u20141,800,000 ducats for Calle del Scarlatto\u2014to stand any chance in our Republic's complex marketplace. I shall prepare another offer accordingly when my own affairs permit further negotiation on this parcel or others deemed worthy by the Doge himself.Until then, other avenues await.Best regards,Niccol\u00f2",
