She even mentioned mainland suppliers and reasonable prices\u2014this shows she genuinely wants to assist me as an old acquaintance.)(After all, I am a Popolani merchant; although not from the patrician class, it has long been ingrained in my blood that survival depends on seizing opportunities. Her proposal is very timely\u2014if I can secure this supply contract now, my bakery business won\u2019t be affected again next season, and I\u2019ll have more time to focus on expanding other ventures.)(Alright, then let\u2019s respond to Sofia like this: First express gratitude for her thoughtfulness, then directly agree because the terms are indeed favorable. But as a Popolani merchant, we also need to show prudence\u2014so while accepting the agreement, remind her of the importance of maintaining quality standards in our conversation.)</think>Marco (Popolani) : \"Consiglio, you've been very helpful. This supply plan sounds excellent; I can ensure my bakeries have a steady source throughout the year now.\"",
