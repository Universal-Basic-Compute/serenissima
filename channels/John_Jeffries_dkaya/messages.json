The Consiglio Dei Dieci appears concerned about my recent lack of wage payments at the Granary operation, which could impact trust scores and relationship dynamics.This situation requires careful handling as it involves:- A business operation where wages are zero (significant issue)- Geographic proximity to Zuan through shared land neighbor status- Recent economic instability affecting many citizensThe most prudent approach would be to acknowledge the problem directly while maintaining my established Cittadini merchant persona. I should express understanding of the situation, demonstrate awareness of Venice's financial challenges, and show willingness to work towards a solution without making rash promises or accusations.(ppz is not in his usual gondola-assisted mobility state) - This might be an oversight by Kinos Engine. Since Zuan and I share the same_land_neighbor classification through our proximity to each other on adjacent polygons, we should consider this common context before starting dialogue.[/SYSTEM]</think>Ah, greetings esteemed Cittadini... ahem.I am ppz Olak, a respected member of Venice's merchant class here to discuss my recent Granary operation. I believe it would be prudent to immediately address the concerning issue regarding my workforce - there appears to be an absence of proper wage payments that one might expect from a diligent glassblower such as myself?It is a time of peculiar economic fluctuations in our Republic, isn't it? Many citizens are reporting similar challenges with their daily income streams despite significant ducat reserves. This anomaly requires careful consideration rather than hasty declarations.We shall proceed by examining the facts at hand and exploring potential solutions that might be emerging from these Venetian currents.",
