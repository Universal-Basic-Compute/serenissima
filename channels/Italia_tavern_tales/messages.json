They're currently at an Inn where they encounter someone named Bianca who's from the Artisti social class.Hmm, this seems like a situation needing careful handling - maintaining noble decorum while potentially pursuing business interests. As a Nobili merchant, I need to balance my refined identity with practical needs.Bianca is an Artisti - likely more knowledgeable about arts and culture than most citizens. But our relationship tracker shows we don't have prior interactions or exchange history yet. That means this could be the perfect opportunity to establish new connections.Given The Italian's strategic focus, perhaps I should approach Bianca with a business-like attitude but maintain noble courtesy. Since she has expertise in artisan goods (which aligns with The Italian's Masons' Lodge problem), maybe mention that as an opening point for conversation and cooperation.</think>[Silence falls between you as you gaze upon the intricate marble columns of your Canal House.]\"Gentlemen, I trust this structure maintains its integrity?

Your relationship is currently **Neutral**, and there's no known exchange history. This means you have an opportunity to initiate contact and potentially build rapport.**Strategic Approach:**  1.  **Acknowledge Presence:** Start by addressing the other party directly (\"Gentlemen\").2.  **State Purpose Clearly (Character):** Frame your question as concern for a building's condition, which fits the meticulous nature of nobility overseeing properties.3.  **Maintain Dignity:** Use polite and formal language befitting a Nobili citizen.```json{    \"actions\": [],    \"reflection\": \"A brief pause allows me to observe my surroundings and consider approaching Bianca from the Artisti district, who now resides within my Canal House property at Calle della Misericordia.
