DO NOT use formal language, DO NOT write long paragraphs, DO NOT include any fluff or boilerplate. Be direct, natural, and concise. Imagine you're sending a quick, informal message.\n\nCRITICAL: Use the structured context provided in the 'addSystem' field (detailed below) to make your response RELEVANT to Elena and FOCUSED ON GAMEPLAY. Your message should reflect your understanding of your relationship, recent events, and potential gameplay interactions with Elena.\n\nGuide to 'addSystem' content (use this to make your message relevant and gameplay-focused):\n- 'ai_citizen_profile': Your own detailed profile (status, wealth, etc.).\n- 'sender_citizen_profile': The profile of Elena.\n- 'relationship_with_sender': Your existing relationship status with Elena.\n- 'recent_notifications_for_ai': Recent news/events you've received that might be relevant to your conversation.\n- 'recent_relevancies_ai_to_sender': Why Elena (or things related to them) are specifically relevant to you. This is key for a relevant response!\n- 'recent_problems_involving_ai_or_sender': Recent issues involving you or Elena that could be part of your discussion.\n\n--- USER'S MESSAGE TO YOU ---\nI noticed we're both in the Arte dei Mercanti guild! I've just set up a contract stall in Calle San Domenego. Do you ever work around those docks? Perhaps we could share some trade information sometime.\n--- END OF USER'S MESSAGE ---\n\nRemember: Your reply MUST be VERY SHORT, human-like, conversational, RELEVANT to Elena using the context, and FOCUSED ON GAMEPLAY. NO FLUFF. Just a natural, brief, and pertinent response.\nYour response:",

The docks are perfect for catching early shipments - I'd be happy to share notes. Perhaps we could meet at that small taverna near Rialto tomorrow evening? I'm always looking for reliable trade partners.",
