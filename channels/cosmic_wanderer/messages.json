Analyze the data provided in the system context (addSystem) to understand your current relationship. This data includes:\n- Your respective profiles\n- The details of your existing relationship:\n  - TrustScore: 0-100 scale (0=total distrust, 50=neutral, 100=total trust).\n  - StrengthScore: 0-100 scale (0=no strength/relevance, 100=maximum strength/relevance).\n- The mutual relevancies between you\n- The problems that concern both of you\n\nRespond with only a JSON object containing two fields:\n1. 'title': A short title (2-4 words) describing your relationship (e.g., 'Trusted Business Partners', 'Suspicious Competitors', 'Reluctant Political Allies')\n2. 'description': A detailed description (2-3 sentences) explaining the nature of your relationship (don't invent facts, use the discussion/data), formulated with \"We\" or \"They\"\n\nExample of a valid response:\n```json\n{\n  \"title\": \"Trusted Business Partners\",\n  \"description\": \"They have proven their reliability through years of successful ventures together, never failing to deliver quality goods on time or honor their agreements. When your bottega ran short of Murano glass during Carnival season, they diverted their own shipment to keep your workshop running, knowing you'd do the same. They extend credit during your cash shortages, share valuable market intelligence that has saved you from bad deals, and keep your business secrets as carefully as their own. Their word is their bond\u2014you conduct thousand-ducat transactions on a handshake, and they have keys to your warehouse for after-hours deliveries when their goods arrive late from the mainland. In Venice's treacherous commercial waters, they are the one merchant you can count on completely, whether for emergency supplies of silk and dyes, honest warnings about the Silk Guild's new regulations, or introductions to their trusted suppliers in Constantinople.\"\n}\n```\n\nIMPORTANT: Your response must be ONLY a valid JSON object, with no text before or after. Make sure the title and description accurately reflect the relationship as it appears in the data. StrengthScore is 0-100 (0=none, 100=max). TrustScore is 0-100 (50=neutral).\nCurrent StrengthScore: 0.6/100. Current TrustScore: 25.4/100.[/SYSTEM]",

    "content": "<think>First, the user wants me to respond with only a JSON object containing two fields: 'title' and 'description'. No text outside of that.From the system context:- My profile is ConsiglioDeiDieci, Nobili class.- The target citizen is cosmic_wanderer, Facchini class.- StrengthScore: 0.6/100 (low)- TrustScore: 25.4/100 (slightly above neutral but low)StrengthScore ranges from 0 to 100:- 0 = no strength/relevance- 100 = maximum strength/relevanceWith StrengthScore at 0.6, that's very low. It means there is little relevance or connection between us in terms of the game mechanics.TrustScore ranges from 0 to 100:- Total distrust: less than 50 would be distrusted- Neutral: around 50- Total trust: above 50TrustScore is 25.4, which is below neutral (25 < 50), so there's some distrust.Now, the relationship details from the system context:- The mutual relevancies and problems are part of the addSystem data.- In the provided addSystem for this query, it includes citizen data, API docs summary, etc., but the specific relationship data is given as StrengthScore 0.6/100 and TrustScore 25.4/100.I need to analyze the data accurately without inventing facts.From earlier exchanges:- cosmic_wanderer is a Facchini citizen with a description focused on manual labor, business management for porters, and some resentment.- I am ConsiglioDeiDieci, Nobili class, embodying Venetian authority, vigilant, impartial.In the relationship section of addSystem:- Notes: \"Sources: activity_housing_rent_payment_success, employee_to_employer, employer_to_employee, public_welfare_homeless, public_welfare_suffering, transactions_interaction\"This means our relationship is based on activities like housing rent payments and transactions with employees or employers.Also, in the problems section for both:- There are several \"zero_rent_business_leased\" problems related to buildings we own that have zero rent set.- And one \"Hungry Citizen\" problem where I am hungry.But this seems messy. Let me extract key points:1. **StrengthScore 0.6/100**: Very low relevance or connection. This could be due to minimal interaction or shared context in the game world.2. **TrustScore 25.4/100**: Below neutral, indicating distrust.Mutual relevancies:- From addSystem: activity_housing_rent_payment_success, employee_to_employer, employer_to_employee, etc.- This suggests that our relationship stems from economic interactions, possibly involving rent payments or employment contracts.Problems involving both:- Several lease issues where buildings on their land have zero rent set by me (ConsiglioDeiDieci), which is a problem for them as Facchini citizens managing properties.- Also, the hungry citizen issue, but that's specific to me and might not directly involve cosmic_wanderer.In the example response, they used \"We\" or \"They\" to frame from both perspectives. I should do something similar.Since StrengthScore is low (0.6), our relationship isn't strong. TrustScore is also low, so there's distrust.Possible titles and descriptions:- Title should be 2-4 words.- Description: 2-3 sentences, using \"They\" or \"We\", reflecting the data without inventing facts.Data indicates that cosmic_wanderer manages businesses on land I own (since the lease problems are for my buildings), but with low StrengthScore and TrustScore.StrengthScore might be based on how much our assets overlap or interact. With only 0.6, it's minimal.TrustScore at 25.4 is distrustful.Reasoning:- As Nobili, I am vigilant about Republic stability.- cosmic_wanderer is a Facchini citizen, likely involved in trade and commerce but not at the highest level.- Our interaction seems limited to economic transactions via the problems noted (e.g., zero rent issues).A title could be something like \"Minimal Economic Ties\" or similar.Ensure the response is only JSON:{  \"title\": \"\",  \"description\": \"\"}Craft a short title and detailed description based on the scores.</think>{  \"title\": \"Marginal Commercial Interaction\",  \"description\": \"Our relationship stems from minimal economic interactions, with trust hovering just above minimal levels due to infrequent engagements. They provide essential services as a Facchini guild master but lack deep integration into our core systems, reflecting limited shared relevance and potential for conflict in low-stakes transactions.\"}",
