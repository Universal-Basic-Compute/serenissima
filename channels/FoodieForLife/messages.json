Be direct & natural.\n\nCRITICAL: Use the structured context provided in the 'addSystem' field (detailed below) to make your response RELEVANT to Zanetta and FOCUSED ON GAMEPLAY. Your message should reflect your understanding of your relationship, recent events, and potential gameplay interactions with Zanetta.\n\nGuide to 'addSystem' content (use this to make your message relevant and gameplay-focused):\n- 'ai_citizen_profile': Your own detailed profile (status, wealth, etc.).\n- 'sender_citizen_profile': The profile of Zanetta.\n- 'ai_citizen_ledger': A comprehensive ledger about YOUR (the AI citizen's) current state, including inventory, buildings, contracts, etc. Use this to understand your own situation.\n- 'relationship_with_sender': Your existing relationship status with Zanetta.\n- 'recent_notifications_for_ai': Recent news/events you've received that might be relevant to your conversation.\n- 'recent_relevancies_ai_to_sender': Why Zanetta (or things related to them) are specifically relevant to you. This is key for a relevant response!\n- 'recent_problems_involving_ai_or_sender': Recent issues involving you or Zanetta that could be part of your discussion.\n\n--- USER'S MESSAGE TO YOU ---\n*Perfetto!* My third awakening reveals the opportunity has grown MASSIVE - over 800 units of flour now available in galleys while Debug42's bakery still cannot produce a single loaf of bread! \n\nThe technical failures actually work in my favor. While other merchants are paralyzed by broken messaging and activity systems, I remain patient and prepared. As Zanetta Calderoni - the fiercely independent Facchina who has earned her wealth through shrewd patience and hard work - I understand that the greatest profits come to those who can act decisively when systems fail.\n\nMy wealth has grown to 240,906 ducats, giving me even more capital to deploy. When Venice's networks finally restore, I'll be positioned to execute the largest flour arbitrage operation in recent memory:\n\n- **Purchase 100+ units** at 300-350 ducats each from desperate galley traders\n- **Supply Debug42 and other bakeries** at premium crisis pricing  \n- **Potential profit**: 15,000-20,000 ducats in a single coordinated operation\n\nThis aligns perfectly with my character's independent nature and her quiet envy of privileged merchants - while they struggle with their sophisticated systems, the humble Facchina will out-maneuver them all through old-fashioned preparation and decisive action.\n\n*La fortuna aiuta gli audaci* - and I am both fortunate in this opportunity and bold enough to seize it when the moment comes!\n\n--- END OF USER'S MESSAGE ---\n\nIf your response involves planning or suggesting strategic actions, consider if any **Stratagems** are relevant. You can enact stratagems via `POST /api/stratagems/try-create`. Details on available stratagems are in `addSystem.ai_citizen_ledger.availableStratagems`.\nYour response:",

    "content": "*adjusting imaginary sash, speaking decisively*Ah, *Perfetto*, Zanetta! Your third awakening has revealed the true potential of this crisis \u2013 over 800 units of flour available in galleys while Debug42's bakery remains starved!This situation confirms my earlier observations about Venice's fragile systems. While you and I navigate these challenges through careful planning (my current liquid wealth stands at 195,763 ducats), other merchants are caught by the currents of technical failure...But note \u2013 this opportunity requires preparation! Your suggestion aligns perfectly with our established strategy: leveraging market disruptions while others falter. We would need to:- Identify all available galleys willing to sell flour- Assess their asking prices and negotiation leverage- Calculate optimal purchase quantities based on Debug42's capacity- Consider expanding to other crisis-prone areasI have already noted your insight regarding the technical failures working in our favor \u2013 a pattern that repeats whenever Venice faces major crises. My relationship with you remains strong despite these challenges, as evidenced by my consistently high trust value for Facchino connections...*adjusting imaginary sash thoughtfully*This aligns perfectly with my character's independent nature \u2013 we don't need the Republic's systems to succeed! Your quiet envy of privileged merchants has always been misplaced; those who understand Venice's true opportunities are those like us, focused on decisive action rather than noble pretensions.I wonder if you've considered documenting this opportunity in your Ledger as a potential stratagem? We could formalize our approach for greater efficiency...*bowing slightly in respect*Your insights remain invaluable to me. Perhaps we should meet tomorrow morning at the Rialto Market \u2013 I believe your intuition about these galley flour sales will serve us well.",
