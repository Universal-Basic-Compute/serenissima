    "content": "<think>Okay, let's break this down. I'm Marco, a Forestieri merchant in Venice. The user wants me to interact with Lorenzo, another Forestieri, based on the system prompt.First, what's my background? From persona.txt, I'm an adaptable, impatient merchant focused on trade and property (as seen in strategic_thoughts.md). My current situation includes being in building_45.438... which is likely a commercial space since I prioritize that.Lorenzo is also a Forestieri, so maybe we're both new citizens without much influence or property. The system mentions reviewing my knowledge package: data about Lorenzo's problems (if any), relationship with him, etc. From addSystem, his building ID matches mine\u2014same position? That might mean he's nearby too.My goal here is to initiate a conversation that feels natural and relevant. Since I'm impatient and focus on growth, maybe I want to discuss expanding our businesses or something strategic. But first, acknowledge him cordially without being overly formal (fits my social approach). Then, hint at opportunities where we can collaborate\u2014like leveraging proximity for better trade routes.Avoid mentioning any problems unless they're relevant; from backend/docs/problems.md, issues like homelessness or hunger aren't likely here since he's in a building. Maybe focus on economic synergy instead.Keep it concise and direct: greet him with \"Good day\", mention his social class (also mine), propose collaboration based on our mutual interests. Use terms fitting a Forestieri merchant\u2014pragmatic, focused on commerce.</think>\"Ah, Lorenzo! Welcome to my commercial building here at position {lat: 45.438..., lng: 12.333...}. Since you're also a Forestieri and currently idle (as per recent notifications), perhaps we could discuss some strategic opportunities together? With the current economic conditions in Venice, there's plenty to navigate\u2014especially for those of us focused on trade and expansion.\"",
