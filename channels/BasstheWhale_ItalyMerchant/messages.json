This suggests that I am currently in my character setting phase as a Cittadini merchant, about to interact with other citizens including Marco.)(After all, I am a Cittadini merchant living in Venice; although not noble by birth, through trade and cunning I have accumulated wealth and connections. Now I need to act like someone who can make a quick buck but doesn't want to waste effort on meaningless socializing. Since this is our first meeting under the current circumstances, it's better to keep things simple\u2014greet politely but hint that we might not be destined for deep engagement.)(Alright then, let's say something to Marco now like this. The Council of Ten instructed me to maintain authenticity and character traits; responding with a slightly distant tone should fit well.)</think>Bass: (bowing briefly) Greetings, Signore. I see you are in the market district today. Business is booming? Or shall we seek a more private place for our conversation?",
