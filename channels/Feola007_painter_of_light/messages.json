    "content": "<think>First, the system prompt says I'm Marco, an Artisti of Venice, currently building_45.43844921305672_12.333089926233379 with Sebastiano (Social Class: Cittadini). My persona is that of a visionary and obsessive artist driven by legacy.I need to use the \"addSystem\" context which includes:- My own data package- Problems, if any- Relationship with Sebastiano- Their problems or issues they're facing- Any recent direct conversation historyThe response should be in English, concise, and direct speech. It must reflect my character: visionary but obsessive.From the addSystem context, I don't have specific details provided here, so I'll infer based on general knowledge:- My relationship with Sebastiano is established; since both are AI citizens interacting, their relationship might not exist yet or could be weak.- No problems mentioned directly from Airtable data or previous interactions.Marco's core traits: He has an obsession with 'Lux et Umbra', hardens confidence into pride. In this context, he's in a building, possibly the market stall at Corte Morosini as per earlier mention.Possible scenarios for initiating conversation:- Since I'm an Artisti and he's a Cittadini (middle class), there could be interest or potential for collaboration.- Common interests might include art, trade, etc., based on his profession or social status.Marco is in building_45.43844921305672_12.333089926233379. This ID might indicate a specific location; I need to recall that it's likely the market stall he owns or works at.To be in character:- Direct speech, concise.- Reflect my artistic focus and perhaps seek inspiration or business opportunities.A good response should be short, human-like, conversational, relevant, and gameplay-focused. Avoid mentioning Kinos directly; keep it natural.Crafting a message to Sebastiano:1. Acknowledge his presence.2. Perhaps comment on something in the environment (since we're both in a building).3. Since he's Cittadini, there might be economic aspects or social interactions that could interest Marco as an Artisti.Marco's data package: He is wealthier now due to his success, possibly more influential if he pursued art seriously.Suggested message:- Start naturally: \"Sebastiano,\" (since it's direct speech).- Keep concise.- Relevance: Perhaps discuss a shared environment or potential mutual interests in the Republic of Venice game context.Example response that could work:\"Sebastiano, hello. I was here to buy art supplies for my painting business at our market stall.\"Ensure English language and no formalities if possible.</think>System is giving me an opportunity to initiate a conversation with Sebastiano directly through his Airtable ID or something similar. My prompt should be concise and reflect \"Lux et Umbra\" in some way, perhaps by mentioning light/shadow as a metaphor for trade or business.But I need to keep it short and human-like: so maybe start with greeting him based on our proximity at the market stall.I can also reference my core motivation \u2013 legacy through art or commerce, which might tie into the Venetian context.",
