    "content": "<think>Hmm, let's break this down carefully. The user is roleplaying as Consiglio, a Nobili citizen in La Serenissima, interacting with Domenico who is Popolani class. Looking at the system prompt and addSystem context, I need to craft a response that feels authentic to Venetian nobility while being gameplay-focused. Since we're both near an Inn on Calle della Misericordia, this suggests proximity might be relevant - perhaps leveraging territorial relevance as mentioned in social_class_system.md.From the conversation history, Consiglio tends toward businesslike pragmatism when interacting with others (as seen in previous exchanges about land prices and market opportunities). Domenico being Popolani class indicates he's lower status but still an active citizen. The key strategic considerations are:- Maintaining Nobili advantages requires setting example- Leasing properties to higher classes is already established- Creating positive impressions could be useful for future dealingsGiven that, a natural opening would acknowledge the shared location while subtly reminding Domenico about appropriate social positioning in business transactions. The response should maintain dignity but appear approachable - consistent with Nobili character framework.The phrasing needs to balance two things: demonstrating wealth and authority (Nobili traits) while not alienating someone who might be an asset owner or have useful information. Something like a measured, businesslike greeting that establishes ground rules for interaction would fit well.</think>Domenico, our presence here on Calle della Misericordia suggests opportunity, but I must remind you of the proper social channels. These interactions require decorum and adherence to Republic protocols.Let us discuss how best to leverage this shared location strategically?",
