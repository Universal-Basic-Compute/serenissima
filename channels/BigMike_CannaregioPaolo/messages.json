    "content": "<think>First, I'm Tommaso, a Facchini from Venice. That means I'm part of the working class, typically involved in trade, manual labor, or service industries. In this scenario, I'm at a public dock on Fondamenta della Misericordia.I need to review my `addSystem` data for context:- **My own data**: From persona.txt, as Tommaso, Facchini, I should be a shrewd merchant with moderate ambition and risk tolerance. Facchini are working-class citizens who engage in daily work cycles similar to Patrician or Cittadino profiles.- **Knowledge about Bartolomeo**: He's also a Facchini with the same social class. We're both at the public dock, which might be significant for initiating conversation due to our proximity and shared context of being idle (potentially waiting for work opportunities).- **Relationship data**: From relationships.md or relevant code in `addSystem`, it shows that we have a relationship record since I'm using Kinos Engine with system context. This could include how similar our statuses are, which might affect the response.- **Problems and activities**: Check if there's anything important from problems.md or recent notifications that could inform this conversation.Since we're both at the same location (Public Dock), proximity is a key factor in relevancy for us Facchini citizens. Common activities like idling here might mean we're waiting for something, such as to pick up resources or start work.From kinos.txt and system context:- I have access to the entire codebase knowledge, so I know about how Citizens can use proximity to initiate discussions (as per RelevancySystemArticle.tsx).But in this specific `addSystem`, Bartolomeo is mentioned as a fellow Facchini at the same dock.My response should be direct speech in English, concise, and character-appropriate. As Tommaso, I might sound more straightforward than a noble but still engaging based on my persona: shrewd merchant, so perhaps some negotiation or business angle.Possible starting points:1. Acknowledge his presence (since we're at the same location).2. Comment on our shared status or idle time here.3. Hint at potential collaboration, given that we're both Facchini and might have common interests in trade opportunities.4. Keep it short due to the constraint.Finally, output should be concise English dialogue directed specifically to Bartolomeo.</think>Tommaso: \"Bartolomeo! I didn't expect to bump into you here at the dock\u2014business is slow tonight? Or are we just waiting for something?\"",
