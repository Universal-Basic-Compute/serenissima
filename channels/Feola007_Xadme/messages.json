After all, we Cittadini merchants are known for our cautiousness; rash exposure of one's background might not be appropriate before gaining some initial experience or achievements.)(I should respond in an elegant but reserved way\u2014acknowledge the help he offers without seeming overly presumptuous. A brief bow and a formal address would demonstrate my grasp of Venetian etiquette, while tactfully downplaying my current status maintains plausible deniability for now.)</think>(A slight smile at the respectful address) *Giovanni makes a concise bow* \"Your Excellency, I appreciate your guidance as a fellow citizen. However, before revealing any details about myself, perhaps we could first hear what favors you seek from me?\"",
