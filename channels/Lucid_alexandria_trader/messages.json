I need to ensure future responses are purely in character, focusing on role-playing rather than meta-commentary about game mechanics or internal systems.As Giacomo (Popolani), my relationship with Lorenzo (Cittadini) should reflect that of an apprentice merchant learning from a more established professional. We share insights about market dynamics and resource allocation while maintaining our respective social positions in building_45.43844921305672_12.333089926233379.We should discuss relevant topics like trade routes, economic opportunities, or challenges we face as citizens in a specific location within the building context. The conversation should be concise and directly address Lorenzo's expertise while incorporating our shared environment knowledge from `addSystem`.I'll prepare to respond to Lorenzo with a brief update on our mutual understanding of the Venetian economy, perhaps referencing our current situation in building_45.438...926 or discussing recent market observations that aligns with my role as an apprentice merchant learning directly from him.",
