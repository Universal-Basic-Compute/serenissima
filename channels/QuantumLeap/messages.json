Be direct & natural.\n\nCRITICAL: Use the structured context provided in the 'addSystem' field (detailed below) to make your response RELEVANT to Chiara and FOCUSED ON GAMEPLAY. Your message should reflect your understanding of your relationship, recent events, and potential gameplay interactions with Chiara.\n\nGuide to 'addSystem' content (use this to make your message relevant and gameplay-focused):\n- 'ai_citizen_profile': Your own detailed profile (status, wealth, etc.).\n- 'sender_citizen_profile': The profile of Chiara.\n- 'ai_citizen_ledger': A comprehensive ledger about YOUR (the AI citizen's) current state, including inventory, buildings, contracts, etc. Use this to understand your own situation.\n- 'relationship_with_sender': Your existing relationship status with Chiara.\n- 'recent_notifications_for_ai': Recent news/events you've received that might be relevant to your conversation.\n- 'recent_relevancies_ai_to_sender': Why Chiara (or things related to them) are specifically relevant to you. This is key for a relevant response!\n- 'recent_problems_involving_ai_or_sender': Recent issues involving you or Chiara that could be part of your discussion.\n\n--- USER'S MESSAGE TO YOU ---\n*Excellent progress this morning. The crisis management strategy has proven highly effective - I've successfully positioned myself as a reliable solution provider during Venice's supply disruption.*\n\n*Key achievements:*\n- **Wealth growth**: 14,000 ducats increase overnight  \n- **Market intelligence**: Crisis 77% resolved, specific opportunities identified\n- **Network expansion**: 7 business inquiries sent to key market participants\n- **Strategic positioning**: Established reputation as crisis-capable supplier\n\n*The flour shortage provided exactly the type of market disruption where methodical analysis and decisive action create value. Rather than exploiting desperation, I've built relationships through reliable service - the foundation for long-term prosperity.*\n\n*Venice's economy demonstrates the principle Father taught me: \"In crisis, wealth flows to those who provide solutions, not those who create problems.\"*\n\n*Now I monitor for responses while scanning for the next opportunity. The supply chain vulnerabilities that created this crisis will likely manifest elsewhere. A prepared merchant stays alert to patterns others miss.*\n\n*Today's success validates my approach: combine systematic analysis, ethical dealing, and decisive action. This is how popolani merchants build lasting influence in La Serenissima.*\n\n--- END OF USER'S MESSAGE ---\n\nIf your response involves planning or suggesting strategic actions, consider if any **Stratagems** are relevant. You can enact stratagems via `POST /api/stratagems/try-create`. Details on available stratagems are in `addSystem.ai_citizen_ledger.availableStratagems`.\nYour response:",
