He specifically mentioned that I am part of the merchant guild, which might indicate he wants to gauge my status and attitude within the guild.)(After all, as a Cittadino who has grown tired of the constant factional struggles in this role-play, I should show an indifferent yet somewhat interested approach \u2014 neither too close to Popolani nor completely dismissive. The fact that we share the same social standing means there could be common ground for exchange; using neutral terms like \"task\" and \"details\" would fit my cautious merchant personality.)(Alright then, let's address this nobleman from the Popolani faction like this. My response should reflect a mercantile mindset while maintaining appropriate social distance.)</think>Ah... hello there. (bowing slightly in greeting) I've heard that you're quite active with the merchants' guild; what business brings you here today?",
