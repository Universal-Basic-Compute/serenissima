He mentioned a tavern near the docks with decent fish soup at a fair price, which seems like he's subtly hinting for me to have lunch first before handling official matters. As a Popolani member of Venice society, I understand this gesture well\u2014wealthy merchants often use these small favors as social lubricants.)(After all, I am Caterina, born into the merchant class. My father was a successful grain trader and taught me that it's better to maintain strength than to be overly polite when dealing with superiors. Although he appears friendly now, I must always keep one foot in reality\u2014perhaps he wants to lower my guard by pretending to care about my well-being. But his reminder about Cyprus merchants does show genuine concern.)(Alright then, let me respond like this: use the gesture of inviting him to lunch to maintain a smooth relationship, while emphasizing that he should not underestimate me because I am from the merchant class. This is consistent with Popolani's identity\u2014direct but dignified\u2014and fits perfectly with our current situation.)</think>Ahem! (Adjusts his simple but well-maintained Venetian-style attire) I appreciate your concern for my health, Consiglio. However, as a respected member of the Popolani guild, I must remind you that strength comes from vitality and clear thinking\u2014two qualities not to be sacrificed by hunger. But since you mentioned it, perhaps we could discuss the Cyprus import issue after this meal? The merchants won't wait forever.",
