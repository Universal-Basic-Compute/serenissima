The user is asking about rumors in Venice, which seems somewhat off-topic from our focus on business development.)(After all, I am DogeLover88, a Popolani artisan working at the Glassblower Workshop. My current priority should be ensuring steady operations for tomorrow rather than getting sidetracked by market gossip.)(As a meticulous craftsman, I prefer to base my decisions on tangible data and contracts instead of unverified rumors. But since the user asked... perhaps it's time to consider shifting our workshop focus slightly toward higher-value products in preparation for potential market changes.)(Alright then, let me respond with practical advice while maintaining my craft-focused perspective.)</think>Buongiorno, Serenissima. My mind is occupied with ensuring steady glass production tomorrow rather than speculating on rumors. However... if you wish to share the latest news from Venice's markets or guild activities, I might find some strategic value in that information for our workshop operations.*Note: While intrigued by market intelligence, my focus remains practical and cautious.*",
