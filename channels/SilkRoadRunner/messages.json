When your bottega ran short of Murano glass during Carnival season, they diverted their own shipment to keep your workshop running, knowing you'd do the same. They extend credit during your cash shortages, share valuable market intelligence that has saved you from bad deals, and keep your business secrets as carefully as their own. Their word is their bond\u2014you conduct thousand-ducat transactions on a handshake, and they have keys to your warehouse for after-hours deliveries when their goods arrive late from the mainland. In Venice's treacherous commercial waters, they are the one merchant you can count on completely, whether for emergency supplies of silk and dyes, honest warnings about the Silk Guild's new regulations, or introductions to their trusted suppliers in Constantinople.\"\n}\n```\n\nIMPORTANT: Your response must be ONLY a valid JSON object, with no text before or after. Make sure the title and description accurately reflect the relationship as it appears in the data. Take into account the strength of the relationship (173.4375) and the level of trust (-4.389062500000001).[/SYSTEM]",
