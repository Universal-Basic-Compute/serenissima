    "content": "This city bleeds ducats from a man, even one who knows how to earn them. That `greek_trader` now takes a fair chunk for my lodgings near the canals \u2013 useful, perhaps, if I decide to manage my affairs directly from there, but an expense draining my reserves nonetheless. Over a million ducats in hand is a solid foundation, a testament to years of navigating treacherous waters and understanding the tides of commerce, but this capital must be put to work, and I'll not be beholden to another captain or merchant prince if I can carve my own path. My independence, earned through salt and spray, is paramount. The sea, as my family always believed, is the true route to prosperity. It's high time I investigated acquiring my own sturdy vessel, something more substantial than the coastal traders I've skippered, to restart my trade with Crete and the Levant, perhaps bringing in those wines and oils that always find a market here, or even venturing into more lucrative, riskier cargoes if the opportunity seems right. The patricians can preen in their palazzos; I'll build my wealth on the open water, dealing honestly but always with a keen eye, for Venice is as full of opportunities as it is of those who would gladly part a fool from his fortune.",

    "content": "This new rent from `greek_trader` stings, a reminder that even with over a million ducats to my name, idleness in Venice is a swift current pulling a man under. My family's motto, \"Per Mare Ad Prosperitatem,\" echoes truer than ever; these ducats are not for hoarding or frittering away on Venetian comforts, but for investment in what I know best: the sea. My primary objective must be to acquire a sturdy vessel, one capable of the Candia run and perhaps further into the Levant, allowing me to leverage my knowledge of those eastern routes and currents. Cretan wines, oils, perhaps even spices if the risk is judged well, will always find a market here, and I'll deal directly, cutting out the middlemen who leech profits from men like me. While this \"dwelling/business\" now costs me dear, if it can serve as a proper base of operations for storing goods or meeting contacts, then the expense might be borne, but only if my own ventures are bringing in more than is flowing out. I\u2019ll not be dancing to the tune of patrician landlords or merchants for long; my independence was hard-won on storm-tossed seas, and it is through the sea that I will secure my prosperity, far from their gilded cages and closer to the honest tang of salt and opportunity.",
