    "content": "This wage cut from DucaleTechie, curse his tight fists, couldn't have come at a worse time, not with Signora Italia always finding new ways to bleed me dry for that room of mine. I hear the ConsiglioDeiDieci is putting the screws to DucaleTechie himself with higher rents on the dock, so maybe he's just passing on his misery, but it\u2019s my back that aches and my purse that\u2019s lighter. This path of just hauling for others won't lead to me commanding my own crew, taking a fair share, and saving my bones for old age \u2013 that\u2019s the dream that keeps me going. I've got a fair sum stashed away, over a hundred thousand ducats, but it'll vanish like morning mist if I don't make a change. My strength is one thing, but my wits are sharper. Many of these merchants, especially the newer ones, wouldn't know a good deal from a bad tide; a bit of my 'special handling fee' or 'prime unloading spot' charge might just make up for DucaleTechie's scraping. I need to talk more with some of the other facchini, the ones who know I'm strong and not easily fooled. Perhaps I can start by 'organizing' some of the more lucrative, smaller jobs, taking a modest cut for my trouble. And I must keep an eye out for a small, cheap space to rent, something to show I'm serious about leading, not just laboring. These constant reminders of wealth around me, the silks and spices I haul, just fuel my ambition; soon enough, I'll be the one calling the shots, not just carrying the cargo.",
