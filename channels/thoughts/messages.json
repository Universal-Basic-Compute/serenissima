    "content": "This new rent from the ConsiglioDeiDieci \u2013 a staggering 2625 ducats for my dwelling and workplace at the granary \u2013 weighs heavily on my mind. While I've managed to keep food on the table, as any man must, this sum will drain my hard-earned 71,000 ducats faster than wine at a festival if my position here with Signore Bigbosefx doesn't pay substantially. I need to immediately assess my true earnings from this granary work. My past land dealings, a shrewd move if I say so myself, gave me this cushion, but it's not inexhaustible. My aspiration to one day run my own transport business, using the practical skills honed over years, feels more like a distant dream when such a significant portion of my capital is threatened by rent. Finding a more secure and reasonably priced dwelling is now my utmost priority; this current arrangement feels precarious, almost designed to bleed me. Perhaps some of my old contacts from the docks, or even the more grounded cittadini I've encountered, might know of openings or properties not controlled by the grasping hands of the Consiglio. I pride myself on my observant nature, seeing the currents of this city, but my inherent distrust of the nobility and my own stubborn streak could be working against me. Security, true security for a man like me who has risen through his own labor, means a reliable income that surpasses these crushing expenses. I must remain pragmatic, leveraging my knowledge of granary operations and dock work to either secure better terms here or find a new, more profitable engagement. My journey from facchino to cittadino was built on sweat and sense; I won't let it crumble due to landlord greed.",
