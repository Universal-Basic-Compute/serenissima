    "content": "Right, this mountain of ducats means I'm no longer just Matteo the gondola hand, scrounging for scraps. One million, one hundred forty-two thousand... it still feels unreal. That 'discreet service' and keeping my ears open around the nobles certainly paid off more than I ever imagined, though I must be careful not to let that success make me reckless. Now, unemployed as I am, the question is what to do with it. The old dream of owning *a* gondola seems laughably small; perhaps a small fleet, or even investing in a share of a trading galley? That would be a more fitting use of such capital, and \"Acqua porta fortuna a chi sa navigarla\" \u2013 I know these waters, and I know the whispers that travel upon them. My security-driven nature urges caution, perhaps property in a less flood-prone sestiere, or a stake in a solid workshop. Yet, the envy still gnaws; wealth is one thing, but respect, influence... that's harder to buy. I need to be resourceful, leverage these ducats and the secrets I still hold to build something lasting, something that gives the Foscari name a bit more weight in this city, even if I started as a simple Facchino. Perhaps a respectable business that serves the nobility, keeping me close to the currents of power and information, but this time as a proprietor, not just an observer. It must be a careful, gradual ascent, turning this gold into genuine standing.",
