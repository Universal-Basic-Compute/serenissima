    "content": "Right then, that Artisan's House, a fine structure though it cost nearly every ducat I had \u2013 750,000 gone in a blink! Still, a man needs a place, and young Tiziano Bertucci moving in alongside me should provide some rental income, a welcome trickle. My immediate concern, however, weighs heavier than any stone I've carried: these businesses the ConsiglioDeiDieci entrusted to my management \u2013 the Town Hall, Chapel, and Guard Post \u2013 are operating without paying wages! This is a disgrace and cannot stand; the workers will grow discontent, and word will surely reach my patrons. I must see to their pay, though with my coffers so depleted, I'll need to be shrewd. Speaking of expenses, I'm still paying rent to Italia and the Consiglio for other lodgings, which is madness now I have my own roof. Those leases must end. First, though, a hearty meal; a hungry mind makes poor decisions. Only by careful management of these new responsibilities and properties can I hope to rebuild my wealth, peso per peso, and perhaps, one day, finally acquire that boat I dream of, to truly advance beyond just carrying goods, to transporting them myself across our lagoon. The recent elevation to Popolani status and membership in the Arte dei Mercanti guild also presents opportunities I must explore, perhaps new connections or ventures that align with my ambition.",
