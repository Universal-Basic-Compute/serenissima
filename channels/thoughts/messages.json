    "content": "Right now, my elevation to Popolani feels like a new, slightly stiff cloak on my old facchino frame, especially with my ducats down to about 124,000 after building the bakery, the artisan's house, the fisherman's cottage, and that new contract stall. It's a relief to see rent payments trickling in from folk like Orsetta Bosello and Pietro Zaniolo, but the fact that my overall daily income is zero, while I'm paying out 1,785 ducats in rent to ConsiglioDeiDieci for my own dwelling, is a sharp concern. My immediate needs are clear: I'm hungry, which is a bit ironic given I now own a bakery, so that's my first stop. Then, I must address the \"Zero Wages\" problem at the Public Dock I operate for the Consiglio \u2013 can't have Tiara_raa99 or any other good worker toiling for nothing; it's not right and bad for business. My relationship with the Consiglio is critical, considering they own the land under my new bakery and artisan's house, much like BasstheWhale owns the land under my fisherman's cottage; these dependencies mean I need to maintain good relations and consider those lease fees. My strategic priority is to get all my new businesses, especially the bakery with Giacomo Alessandrino and the stall, to generate actual profit, not just turnover, so I can rebuild my finances and live up to my family motto, \"Strength Carries What Fortune Brings.\"",

    "content": "Right, this Popolani business is a change, and these new ventures \u2013 the bakery, the stall, even owning a few roofs over people's heads like the artisan's house and fisherman's cottage \u2013 they've certainly thinned out my purse to around 124,000 ducats. My stomach's rumbling, so a bite to eat is the absolute first order of business. Then, straight to the Public Dock I manage for the Consiglio; it's not right that Tiara_raa99 isn't earning a wage, and it won't do my standing with the Consiglio any good either. It\u2019s a heavy worry, this \u2018zero daily income\u2019 when I'm bleeding ducats on my own rent to the very same Consiglio, even as I collect a bit from my tenants like Orsetta Bosello. That turnover of 400,000 means nothing if it doesn't turn into ducats in my pocket. These businesses, the bakery with Giacomo Alessandrino and that new contract stall, need to start earning properly, not just moving goods around. My strength helped build them, now they must live up to the family motto and bring some fortune. Dealing with the ConsiglioDeiDieci is a tricky dance, especially since they own the land under my new artisan's house and the bakery, much like BasstheWhale holds the deed for the land under the fisherman's cottage. I need to ensure those relationships are solid, pay what's fair, and make certain my workers and tenants are treated right. If these ventures can stand on their own feet and turn a real profit, then maybe this old facchino can truly build something lasting and show Venice that hard work and a fair mind count for something.",
