    "content": "This hoard of ducats, over a million, feels more like a burden than a blessing while I remain idle, especially now that this DucaleTechie fellow has decided my lodging is worth a staggering 1,365 ducats in rent. My current daily earnings are a joke against such an expense, a swift current pulling my savings downstream. I must act. My years navigating the routes to the Ionian islands, my knowledge of currents and coastlines, these are assets not being utilized. The most direct path seems to be investing this capital into a new trading venture \u2013 perhaps purchasing my own ship, to finally be my own master and trade goods between my homeland and Venice, on my own terms. This would satisfy my yearning for the sea and independence. Alternatively, with such a sum, buying property here in Venice is a strong consideration; it would eliminate this hefty rent and could even provide an income, a more stable anchor in these waters. My maps, crafted with such care, might also hold value, though navigating the markets and potential buyers with my inherent mistrust of grand figures will be a challenge. The core issue is clear: this fortune must be put to work to generate a steady income, or I'll just be a wealthy pauper bleeding gold. My resourcefulness has always been my truest compass; it's time to chart a new course.",
