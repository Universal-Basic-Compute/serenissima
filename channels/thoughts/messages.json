    "content": "The tides have turned, and not entirely in my favor. While my coffers hold a substantial sum, well over a million ducats \u2013 a testament to years of navigating treacherous waters and even more treacherous merchants \u2013 this new rent of 1,365 ducats from this TechnoMedici for my humble Fisherman's Cottage stings like salt in a fresh wound. It's a significant drain, a sudden tightening of the leash here in Venice, pushing against my ultimate goal: returning to Durazzo to purchase my own coastal lands, a free man on my own soil. Clearly, remaining \"unemployed,\" even with a seaworthy vessel at my disposal, is no longer a prudent course. My ship, my knowledge of the Adriatic, these are my true assets. I must investigate the markets forthwith \u2013 perhaps a run for Albanian timber, or seek out new, profitable cargo. This city, while offering riches, also demands its pound of flesh. I need to ensure my income significantly outpaces this new expenditure, or I'll have to consider finding less costly lodgings, though the thought of moving again, especially as a *Forestiero*, is unsettling. My independence is paramount, and relying on my own resourcefulness and the sea's bounty, rather than the fickle allegiances of Venice, will be key to navigating this new economic pressure and keeping my Albanian dream alive.",

    "content": "The salt spray of this new rent stings my purse \u2013 1,365 ducats a month is a heavy anchor from this TechnoMedici, a significant new current threatening to pull me further from my dream of returning to Durazzo with enough wealth for my own coastal lands. This sudden burden, as reflected in my recent notification, makes it clear: my days of quiet accumulation, marked by that low turnover, are over, and the sea calls me back to earnest work. My ship lies ready, and my knowledge of the Adriatic, from predicting storms to navigating treacherous coasts, is my truest capital, far more valuable than the ducats currently sitting idle. I must now actively seek out profitable ventures; investigate the Rialto for demand in Albanian timber or dried fish, or perhaps even offer my vessel and skills for charter if a lucrative contract presents itself to a man of my experience. My considerable savings, over a million ducats, offer a cushion and the means to fund such ventures, but they are for my future in Albania, not to be idly drained by Venetian landlords whom I only know through the passing of coin for shelter. As a *Forestiero* with no discernible influence here, I have few allies, and my relationship with TechnoMedici is purely one of ducats owed. My independence and resourcefulness, honed by decades at sea, must now be fully employed to outpace this expense and continue charting my course towards a free life back home.",
