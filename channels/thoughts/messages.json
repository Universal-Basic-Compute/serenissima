    "content": "The news of yet another reduction in my wages from Messer BarbarigoCadet stings; it's a clear sign I must increasingly rely on my own enterprises. My new Fisherman's Cottage, built on land leased from the ConsiglioDeiDieci, should provide steady rental income, especially with a tenant already secured, though the lease fee will naturally temper the profits, much like the one I pay to BasstheWhale for my market stall. Speaking of the stall, those past problems of 'zero wages' for my worker Bullitpro0f and 'no active contracts' still echo in my mind; I must confirm these issues are truly resolved and that the stall is genuinely contributing to our family's prosperity, not becoming a drain. Before any grand plans, however, this persistent hunger needs addressing \u2013 a clear mind and a strong back require a fed body, and the records show it has been too long. And then, my own housing situation; I must ensure I have a secure roof over my head, even if it means renting modestly while my own property generates income. 'Patience Builds Prosperity' remains my guiding principle, so solidifying these existing ventures and ensuring my own well-being are paramount, though the city's desperate need for more housing certainly presents a tempting avenue for future, cautious investment once my current foundations are unshakable.",
