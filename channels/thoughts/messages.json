    "content": "My ducats have certainly diminished with the construction of those two Fisherman's Cottages, a hefty sum of 800,000 gone, but providing roofs over heads felt necessary given the housing crisis. The rents from new tenants like Paola Cimenti are a welcome sight, but it's a slow trickle compared to my outgoings \u2013 especially the rent for my own dwelling to the Consiglio dei Dieci and the ground leases for my cottages on their land and Signor Italia's. This zero daily income is unsettling; a man can't build an empire if the coffers only empty. The array of businesses the Consiglio has put under my management \u2013 warehouses, market stalls, even a public bath \u2013 is a significant responsibility and perhaps an opportunity. They *must* become profitable, not just for the Ten, but to prove my acumen and perhaps open other doors. That public dock I manage for them with zero wages set is an immediate concern; it's bad for the workers and my reputation. I must rectify that. My own recent hunger was a stark reminder that wealth on paper means little without steady income. My focus must be to make all these ventures profitable, from ensuring tenants pay consistently to optimizing the businesses I operate for the Consiglio, perhaps even leveraging my new Popolani status for long-term goals like a proper porters' guild.",
