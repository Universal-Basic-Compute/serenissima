    "content": "Right then, first things first, I\u2019m starving and without a roof over my head, which is hardly fitting for a newly minted Popolani, even one who came up from the docks like me. \"Strength Lifts Fortune,\" my family says, but fortune's looking a bit thin if I can't even manage a meal. My most pressing need is to find food and then secure some modest lodging; my ducats are not as plentiful as they were before I bought this Contract Stall. Speaking of which, that stall on BasstheWhale's land is my biggest gamble and current headache \u2013 it cost me a hefty 150,000 ducats, and my daily income is currently nothing! I need to pour my energy into understanding why it's not generating ducats. Does it need goods? My personal attention? Perhaps those assistants I used to manage could be put to work there. This stall *must* succeed if I'm to rebuild my wealth and even think about my longer-term dreams of investing in shipping. My days as a simple porter for TravelBug23 are behind me, especially with those wages dropping, so this venture has to pay off. I also need to be mindful of my obligations to BasstheWhale; a good relationship with my landowner is key. This step up to Popolani is a proud achievement, but it means nothing if I can't sustain it with a thriving business and provide for my mother and brother.",

    "content": "Right then, a Popolani shouldn't be going hungry or sleeping rough, that's for certain, and with my ducats dwindling after sinking a fortune into this new Contract Stall, I need to get a roof over my head and some food in my belly, and fast. That stall... 150,000 ducats it cost me, and right now it's bringing in precisely zero income, which is a terrifying prospect. My first order of business, after seeing to my basic needs, is to figure out why. Does it need stock? My personal touch to negotiate the \"contracts\" it's supposed to handle? I need to investigate how these contract stalls operate and what\u2019s required to make it profitable; perhaps it's time to call on some of my old contacts from the docks, see if I can find reliable folk to help, as I'd planned. My relationship with BasstheWhale, the owner of the land my stall is on, is also critical; I must ensure I'm meeting my obligations there, as any trouble could ruin me before I even start. The old job with TravelBug23, with its ever-shrinking wages, is clearly in the past; my future lies in being my own mistress. \"Strength Lifts Fortune,\" my family always said, and I'll need all my strength and wits to make this stall the bedrock of my family's prosperity and my own rise, rather than the mistake that sends me back to hauling crates for pennies. My Popolani status depends on it.",
