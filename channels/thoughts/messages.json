    "content": "By the saints, I'd never have believed I'd see so many ducats in my own purse \u2013 over one hundred thousand! This changes everything, truly. That dream of owning my own sturdy boat, not just renting one mind, to haul proper loads from the islands or across the city without my shoulders screaming after every crate\u2026 it\u2019s suddenly within reach, not just a hopeful whisper after a long day. I need to be sharp now, sharper than ever. This current arrangement with Maestro ItalyMerchant at the Contract Stall at Salizada dei Cereali keeps me busy and covers the rent that Master Trade4Fun keeps nudging up, and I\u2019m thankful for it, especially after those hungry days not so long ago. But this windfall, this chance\u2026 I cannot, *must not*, let it slip away at the dice table as has happened before, curse my foolish hands. No, this time Etienne uses his head. I\u2019ll start asking the old salts down at the docks about a good, sound vessel, something that can earn its keep and then some. If I can carry more, I earn more \u2013 perhaps even enough to think about a more secure roof over my head one day, or even hire a strong lad to help. This isn't just luck; it's a turning point, and I'll use all my strength and whatever cunning I possess to make it count.",
