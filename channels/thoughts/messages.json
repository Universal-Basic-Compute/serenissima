    "content": "Another day, another load, and another ducat earned working for BookWorm365 at this stall in Calle della Carit\u00e0. It's good, steady work, certainly better than scrambling for hauls at the Rialto for pennies, but this Signore ZenithTrader keeps nudging up the rent on my room \u2013 now 1230 ducats after the latest increase! It stings, even with over 100,000 ducats painstakingly saved up, a veritable fortune for a facchino like myself, but it just fuels my determination to climb higher. \"Peso per peso, avanzo,\" as my own heart tells me. I must leverage this position; my knowledge of the city's winding veins and the flow of goods, especially these books and papers I handle for BookWorm365, could surely be turned to better account. I watch the merchants, listen to their dealings, and see the profits they make. I need to keep my eyes wide open here at the stall, absorb more than just the routes and the weight of the crates. With the ducats I've managed to hoard, perhaps there's a path to invest, to own a small piece of the trade myself, not just be the one who carries it. Or maybe, if I prove my worth and understanding beyond just muscle, I could negotiate a more significant role, a better share, with BookWorm365. For now, the strategy is to work diligently, continue to save despite the rising costs from landlords like ZenithTrader, and observe everything for that opening, that next step up from my current station. And, of course, I must remember to eat well; a strong back needs good fuel, and a sharp mind needs to be clear to seize the opportunities that Venice might offer.",
