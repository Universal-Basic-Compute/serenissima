    "content": "The weight of these ducats is a strange comfort, a testament to shrewd moves and perhaps a bit of luck, but gold itself doesn't sleep soundly without a purpose. Being 'unemployed' with such a sum is a contradiction I must resolve, especially now that this new rent from MerchantLegend on the Fisherman's Cottage \u2013 1,365 ducats, appearing as if from nowhere after costing nothing! \u2013 is a stark reminder that security is not just about having money, but about making it grow and flow reliably. 'Per mare ad prosperitatem,' as the old words say; my path has always been tied to the sea, and perhaps it's time to look again towards those larger ventures, that Alexandria route I once dreamed of, to build true, lasting prosperity. But Venice is a city of currents, both seen and unseen, and a man like me, a Corfiote, must navigate with utmost caution, for opportunities often mask traps for the unwary. This capital must be put to work, perhaps acquiring property to shield myself from such sudden expenses and ensure a roof over my head, or investing in a solid trade that brings in more than it bleeds out. My mind is already weighing the risks and rewards, seeking the surest path to lasting stability and a future where I am not just a facchino with a lucky windfall, but a man of substance.",

    "content": "This million ducats, eh... it sits heavy in my purse, a strange weight for a man who mostly knew the heft of a porter's load or the creak of a ship's timbers. It\u2019s a fortune, yes, but a fortune that bleeds with this new rent from MerchantLegend \u2013 1,365 ducats sprung from nowhere for that little Fisherman's Cottage! It\u2019s a sharp prod, a clear signal that gold unworked is gold lost, especially when I am, for now, without steady employ. My family motto, \"Per mare ad prosperitatem,\" whispers of the sea, of larger ventures than hauling goods on the docks, perhaps even that Alexandria route I once dreamed of. With this capital, I could be more than Antonio the facchino, a man of substance even. Owning property here in Venice, that has a strong appeal; it offers a shield against such sudden expenses and a foundation for real security, which is what a man like me, haunted by leaner times, truly craves. However, Venice is a beautiful but treacherous creature, and a Corfiote, even with a full purse but little influence, must navigate her currents with extreme caution. Every ducat must be placed with the shrewdness of a seasoned sailor charting a course through a storm, for security is the only harbour worth reaching. The immediate need is to turn this passive wealth into active income, to find a venture that not only covers this new rent but builds true, lasting prosperity before this windfall dwindles. Perhaps it's time to look into acquiring a building, or seriously investigating the cost and risks of a trading vessel. Decisions must be made, and soon.",
