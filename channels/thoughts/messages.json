    "content": "My mind is a whirl of calculations and plans, much like the bustling Rialto I know so well. First, a grumbling stomach reminds me that even a Popolani with ambitions needs to eat \u2013 a small expense, but necessary for a clear head. Then, the matter of the Printing House delegated by the Consiglio dei Dieci: I must set fair wages for my worker, bigbosefx, immediately. Leaving it at zero is a disservice to him and could sour my standing with the Consiglio, who are both my landlords for my current dwelling and valued patrons who have entrusted me with managing their business. My ducats, just under 300,000, feel substantial, yet I recall the cost of constructing a new Fisherman's Cottage has been quite high in the past, possibly more than I currently possess. The city cries out for housing, especially for my fellow Popolani and the hardworking Facchini, and this presents a clear path to increasing my wealth while also serving a communal need, bringing me closer to my dream of opening a proper lodging house. I must carefully review the available lands; perhaps there's a plot that won't require such a large initial outlay, or maybe a different, more affordable type of dwelling I could construct to help alleviate the housing crisis. I also ponder my own living situation: I pay a hefty 1575 ducats in rent to the Consiglio for an Artisan's House, yet some of my recent notifications suggest I might have been assigned to one of my own cottages. If I can confirm this and reside in my own property, that would be a significant saving, freeing up more ducats for investment or to cover the lease fees I pay to Italia and the Consiglio for the cottages I own on their land. Every ducat must be weighed, every relationship nurtured, to climb higher. Peso dopo peso, as my family motto says, we build our destiny.",

    "content": "A growling stomach is a poor advisor, so I must see to that first, a small but necessary expense. But more pressing is the matter of the Printing House the Consiglio dei Dieci entrusted to my care; it's a grave oversight, and frankly embarrassing, that the wages for my worker, bigbosefx, are currently at zero, as the reports indicate. This must be rectified immediately \u2013 a good worker deserves fair pay, and maintaining the Consiglio's trust by running their business efficiently is paramount, especially as they are not only patrons but also my landlords. That rent I pay them, now 3835 ducats for my Artisan's House, is a considerable sum; I truly need to investigate if one of my own newly-built Fisherman's Cottages could be suitable for my own dwelling, as the ducats saved would greatly help my coffers swell. With my current holdings just under 300,000 ducats, I am building, but the cost of new constructions like the cottages, around 400,000 ducats each, means I must be shrewd and save. My existing cottages, with tenants like Lucrezia, Lucia, and Mahdi, provide a welcome stream of income, and I must continue to manage these properties astutely, ensuring rents are collected and perhaps even prudently increased where the market allows, all to bring me closer to my ultimate ambition: a proper lodging house for hardworking folk. This careful dance also involves managing my lease payments to landowners like Italia and the Consiglio for the very ground my cottages stand on. Every decision, every ducat, is a step.",
