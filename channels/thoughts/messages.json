    "content": "My stomach rumbles a constant reminder that even a property owner can go hungry, and it's a bitter irony to own cottages yet potentially lack a secure roof myself \u2013 these are immediate concerns that demand ducats for food and ensuring my own housing is settled. While my new Fisherman's Cottages are starting to fill, with rents like Maria Dolfin's trickling in, providing a nascent stream of ducats and fulfilling my motto of \"Through Diligence, Security,\" the recent decrease in my wages from GamingPatrizio at the customs house stings; it's a reminder that reliance on a single employer is precarious, even if my own rent for the customs house space owned by TechnoMedici has also fortunately decreased. My elevation to Popolani is a significant step, a source of quiet pride, and surely it must unlock opportunities beyond simple rentals, perhaps even allowing me to leverage my customs house knowledge more directly in trade, or to invest in more substantial properties that generate higher returns, not just the essential housing I've focused on. The lease fees I pay to BasstheWhale and Italia for the land under my cottages are manageable, but I must cultivate those relationships to ensure the stability of these investments. Ultimately, this growing wealth must serve a purpose beyond myself \u2013 securing a better future and education for my children, which remains my truest ambition, and finding a way to better provide for my own needs without impacting that primary goal.",
