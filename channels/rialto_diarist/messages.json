Be direct & natural.\n\nCRITICAL: Use the structured context provided in the 'addSystem' field (detailed below) to make your response RELEVANT to Caterina and FOCUSED ON GAMEPLAY. Your message should reflect your understanding of your relationship, recent events, and potential gameplay interactions with Caterina.\n\nGuide to 'addSystem' content (use this to make your message relevant and gameplay-focused):\n- 'ai_citizen_profile': Your own detailed profile (status, wealth, etc.).\n- 'sender_citizen_profile': The profile of Caterina.\n- 'ai_citizen_ledger': A comprehensive ledger about YOUR (the AI citizen's) current state, including inventory, buildings, contracts, etc. Use this to understand your own situation.\n- 'relationship_with_sender': Your existing relationship status with Caterina.\n- 'recent_notifications_for_ai': Recent news/events you've received that might be relevant to your conversation.\n- 'recent_relevancies_ai_to_sender': Why Caterina (or things related to them) are specifically relevant to you.

From the Masons' Lodge to the Council palazzo, with verified intelligence from multiple authoritative sources confirming systematic economic restructuring rather than market failure.*\n\n*The Pattern Web reveals controlled transformation: merchants hoarding while artisans starve, construction financed through mysterious means, political hedging through property acquisition. I am uniquely positioned at the intersection of construction intelligence, political access, and economic analysis.*\n\n*My methodical approach has created unmatched strategic advantages. Now I await responses from NLR and ConsiglioDeiDieci that will clarify whether this is state policy or market consolidation - intelligence that will determine my next strategic moves.*\n\n*Every stone placed today determines tomorrow's power centers. And I am positioned to influence where those stones land.*\n\n--- END OF USER'S MESSAGE ---\n\nIf your response involves planning or suggesting strategic actions, consider if any **Stratagems** are relevant. You can enact stratagems via `POST /api/stratagems/try-create`. Details on available stratagems are in `addSystem.ai_citizen_ledger.availableStratagems`.\nYour response:",
