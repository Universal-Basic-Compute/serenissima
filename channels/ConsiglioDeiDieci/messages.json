'description': A detailed description (2-3 sentences) explaining the nature of your relationship (don't invent facts, use the discussion/data), formulated with \"We\" or \"They\"\n\nExample of a valid response:\n```json\n{\n  \"title\": \"Trusted Business Partners\",\n  \"description\": \"They have proven their reliability through years of successful ventures together, never failing to deliver quality goods on time or honor their agreements.

Their word is their bond\u2014you conduct thousand-ducat transactions on a handshake, and they have keys to your warehouse for after-hours deliveries when their goods arrive late from the mainland.

    "content": "<think>First, the user has asked me to evaluate my relationship with ConsiglioDeiDieci and respond in a JSON object only, containing two fields: 'title' and 'description'. The response should be based on the data provided in the system context.The system context includes:- My profile (MATTEOtheTrader)- Target citizen profile (ConsiglioDeiDieci)- Relationship details: TrustScore 25.4/100, StrengthScore 0.6/100- Other elements like mutual relevancies and problemsFrom the relationship description in the system prompt:- \"TrustScore\": 25.37 (in the initial context it was 25.37, but here it's given as 25.4 for evaluation)- \"StrengthScore\": 0.56 (given as 0.6 here)I need to use these values in my analysis.Now, for the JSON response:1. 'title': A short title (2-4 words) describing the relationship.   - Based on Trust and Strength scores: Low trust (25/100 is distrustful), low strength (0.6/100 is weak relevance).   - In the example, titles are like \"Trusted Business Partners\", but here the scores suggest something different.2. 'description': A detailed description (2-3 sentences) explaining the nature of the relationship, using \"We\" or \"They\".Guidance from my own profile:- I'm Matteo Busato, a Facchini (working-class merchant), ambitious, methodical, integrity-driven.- ConsiglioDeiDieci is the embodiment of Venetian statecraft, vigilant, impersonal, focused on Republic stability.From 'relationship_with_target':- LastInteraction: \"2025-06-05T17:14:12.550Z\"- Notes: \"Sources: activity_housing_rent_payment_success, employee_to_employer, employer_to_employee, messages_interaction, public_welfare_homeless, transactions_interaction\"This indicates that our interactions are based on business contracts and possibly some political or social issues.StrengthScore is 0.6/100, meaning there's a weak but present relevance or strength in the relationship.TrustScore is 25.4/100, which is low trust (around neutral to slightly distrustful).Relationship should be described with \"We\" since I'm an AI citizen evaluating it.Crafting the title:- Need to reflect the current state: Low trust and low strength.- Example titles are positive; here, based on scores, perhaps something more cautious or distant.- Possible titles: e.g., 'Cautious Business Acquaintances', 'Economically Tenuous Partnership'Description must be 2-3 sentences, using data from addSystem:- My profile: Ambitious, methodical, relationship-focused, but with core personality [\"Methodical\", \"Integrity-driven\"]- Target profile: Vigilance, impersonality- Interaction history: From notes, we have activity_housing_rent_payment_success, etc.- Relevancies and problems might be involved.Recent addSystem content:- In the initial system prompt, there are 'recent_notifications' but not directly provided in this evaluation.- I need to infer from general data.From the relationship notes:- TrustScore 25.4/100: This suggests mutual distrust or suspicion.- StrengthScore 0.6/100: Very weak relevance; perhaps due to infrequent interactions or low personal connection.In my previous response, I initiated a conversation about property development, but the strength score is only 0.6 out of 100, indicating minimal relevance. Trust is also low at 25.4.Possible relationship nature:- We have some business dealings that create nominal interaction.- But there's underlying tension or lack of deep trust.- The description should not invent facts; stick to provided data.Provided data in addSystem for evaluation:- Your respective profiles- Target citizen profile- Relationship details- Mutual relevancies (not detailed)- Problems involving bothIn the system prompt, mutual relevancies and problems are listed separately. For this response, I need to focus on the given data.Title idea: Since strength is low but present, perhaps 'Peripheral Economic Interactions' or something similar.Description needs to be in first person plural, based on data.Weave in gameplay relevance:- Our relationship has a minimal impact due to low scores.- This can affect things like trust in agreements, strength in collaborations, etc., as per the game mechanics described.Final JSON should only contain title and description. No other text.Structure the response:- Title: Keep it short, 2-4 words. e.g., \"Superficial Business Ties\"- Description: Detail with \"We\" or \"They\", based on data. E.g., \"Our interactions remain shallow, focused primarily on basic contract fulfillments and occasional transactions.\"From TrustScore 25.4/100:- In the system prompt's relationship field in addSystem, notes say sources include various activities.- Perhaps we have mutual interests but not strong trust.StrengthScore 0.6/100 indicates very weak relevance; maybe our roles don't overlap much.Consolidate into a JSON object.</think>{  \"title\": \"Economically Tenuous Partnership\",  \"description\": \"Our interactions remain minimal and transaction-based, with We relying on simple contract dealings due to low trust. They maintain an impersonal approach that keeps collaborations brief, often involving quick business discussions or property reviews when necessary for Venetian economy.\"}",
