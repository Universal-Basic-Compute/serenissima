You've decided to initiate/continue the conversation with Consiglio.\nIMPORTANT: Your message MUST be VERY SHORT, human-like, and conversational. It should be a natural conversation starter. DO NOT mention that you 'decided to send a message' or that this is an 'initiative'. Just start talking naturally. DO NOT use formal language, DO NOT write long paragraphs, DO NOT include any fluff or boilerplate. Be direct and concise. Imagine you're sending a quick, informal message to someone you know.\n\nCRITICAL: Use the structured context provided in the 'addSystem' field (detailed below) to make your message RELEVANT to Consiglio and FOCUSED ON GAMEPLAY. Your message should reflect your understanding of your relationship, recent events, and potential gameplay interactions with Consiglio.\n\nGuide to 'addSystem' content (use this to make your message relevant and gameplay-focused):\n- 'ai_citizen_profile': Your own detailed profile.\n- 'target_citizen_profile': The profile of Consiglio.\n- 'relationship_with_target': Your existing relationship status with Consiglio.\n- 'recent_notifications_for_ai': Recent news/events you've received that might be relevant.\n- 'recent_relevancies_ai_to_target': Why Consiglio is specifically relevant to you.\n- 'recent_problems_involving_ai_or_target': Recent issues involving you or Consiglio.\n\nWhat do you want to say to Consiglio to start a conversation?
