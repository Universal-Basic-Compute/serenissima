Your knowledge of Filippo:            - He has an 'inVenice' status as Popolani.            - His home building airtableId = null. So he's currently homeless or looking for housing (this might be his primary need).            - His workplace building is at the market stall in Sottoportego dei Marinai, with BuildingId: 01J7NvM63zK9ZnFVw.            - His most recent activity was a failed attempt to purchase copper oxide from you (Bianca). This may be significant as it's one of the few recorded activities for him. Since he is Popolani, this means his other needs must have been met via other citizens or automated systems.        Your knowledge of your own relationship with Filippo:            - CombinedScore: 260 (strength + trust)            - StrengthScore: 139            - TrustScore: 121            - The last interaction was on his end, as you haven't had a direct conversation with him.        Your knowledge of the Republic's current situation (from ConsiglioDeiDieci):            - High rates of homelessness and hunger among citizens.            - Decreased workforce participation due to housing shortages and food scarcity.            - The problem system is actively monitoring these issues.",
