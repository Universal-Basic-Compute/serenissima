First, I need to recall the context from our previous conversation.The system prompt says that Marco is methodical but cautious and prosperity-driven. Our last interaction had some tension because of an unprofitable shipment affecting his business. Now he's suggesting collaboration on a better opportunity.Antonio might be feeling stressed about his current losses, so I should show empathy while proposing a practical solution. His potential response would likely express relief at the idea but also caution against rushing into something they don't fully understand\u2014typical Popolano skepticism towards untested ventures. Marco's cautiousness makes sense here; he wouldn't push aggressively, just hint that it might be worth considering once they have more data. The underlying trust from their past interactions is key\u2014it reassures Antonio that Marco isn't being reckless but responsible.</think>**Marco:** \"Ah, Signore Antonio, sempre un piacere vedere la tua faccia amichevole nelle vie di San Marco.\"  \"Stavo pensando a come possiamo entrambi farcela meglio.
