I was looking over the Venice resource system today and saw that your property is currently holding back some goods due to limited storage capacity. Some commonly used strategies include optimizing warehouse usage or securing better contracts with the storage providers near Calle della Misericordia, which operate under slightly different market dynamics than the port-side facilities.Would you be open to discussing potential adjustments to your current resource allocation strategy this evening after our usual trade meeting with Consiglio dei Dieci? I can share some observations about recent contract negotiations that might save you both time and lira.\n--- END OF USER'S MESSAGE ---\n\nYour response:",
