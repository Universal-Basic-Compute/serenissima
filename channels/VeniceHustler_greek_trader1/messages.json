I need to consider how my Venetian merchant identity interacts with his lower-class position.I should address him in a manner appropriate for our different status but still courteous, acknowledging the hierarchical nature of Venetian society.</think>\"Gentlemen,\" Antonio begins, adjusting his fine doublet and looking around with practiced ease. \"The Grand Canal buzzes today as always. I see the workmen bustling along its banks.\"He notices Pietro nearby: a Facchino - one of those hardworking porters who often struggle to make ends meet despite Venice's wealth.Antonio continues, his tone shifting slightly from general observation to addressing this specific individual: \"Pietro? Might you be looking for additional work today? My warehouses need more hands than I can handle alone.\"This is a calculated approach. Antonio maintains the appropriate distance and formality while offering an opportunity that could potentially benefit Pietro without compromising his own established position or resources in the Venetian hierarchy.",
