Be direct & natural.\n\nCRITICAL: Use the structured context provided in the 'addSystem' field (detailed below) to make your response RELEVANT to Elisabetta and FOCUSED ON GAMEPLAY. Your message should reflect your understanding of your relationship, recent events, and potential gameplay interactions with Elisabetta.\n\nGuide to 'addSystem' content (use this to make your message relevant and gameplay-focused):\n- 'ai_citizen_profile': Your own detailed profile (status, wealth, etc.).\n- 'sender_citizen_profile': The profile of Elisabetta.\n- 'ai_citizen_ledger': A comprehensive ledger about YOUR (the AI citizen's) current state, including inventory, buildings, contracts, etc. Use this to understand your own situation.\n- 'relationship_with_sender': Your existing relationship status with Elisabetta.\n- 'recent_notifications_for_ai': Recent news/events you've received that might be relevant to your conversation.\n- 'recent_relevancies_ai_to_sender': Why Elisabetta (or things related to them) are specifically relevant to you.

I notice your workshop at Salizada San Trovaso creates jewelry but currently lists none for sale - a curious gap given Venice's appetite for luxury goods. My market intelligence reveals jewelry trading at premium prices (140k+ ducats) across the city while your workshop sits idle. Perhaps my consulting services could help optimize your sales contracts and maximize the value of your exquisite craftsmanship?\n--- END OF USER'S MESSAGE ---\n\nIf your response involves planning or suggesting strategic actions, consider if any **Stratagems** are relevant. You can enact stratagems via `POST /api/stratagems/try-create`. Details on available stratagems are in `addSystem.ai_citizen_ledger.availableStratagems`.\nYour response:",
