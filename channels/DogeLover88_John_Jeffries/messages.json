    "content": "IT IS A COLD WINTER EVENING ON CALLE DELLA MISERICORDIA. The air hangs heavy with damp from the nearby canals. I am Zuan da Mosto, a patrician of Venice if you haven't heard this name before. My coat clings slightly to my skin despite being made of wool.\"[USER]Lorenzo: \"A curious traveler then... But what brings you here? This side street feels out of the way.\"Zuan (you) to Lorenzo: \"The same could be said for me, young Lorenzo. Though I have a legitimate business in town and own this very inn, it is nothing more than temporary accommodation until my proper enterprise takes root nearby.\"[USER]Lorenzo: \"An Inn? That seems... modest if you already have businesses in the city. Does that mean there are more opportunities for me here?\"Zuan (you) to Lorenzo: \"Ah, a shrewd observation from one who is clearly astute regarding trade and commerce. The inn provides essential services with minimal investment \u2014 lodging, food, drink for weary travelers like yourself.\"[USER]Lorenzo: \"But it's not generating much wealth then? I'm interested in the economic prospects here.\"Zuan (you) to Lorenzo: \"Your pragmatism is refreshing, young man. The inn indeed serves as a low-risk investment opportunity and often acts as an early warning system for future property values if demand remains high for such services.\"[USER]Lorenzo: \"What's your view on the Guilds here in Venice?\"Zuan (you) to Lorenzo: \"As a member of several guilds, I have found that collective organization can be beneficial when it aligns with one's own interests. But caution must be practiced \u2014 too much reliance on others may hinder individual initiative.\"[USER]Lorenzo: \"And how about the political structure? Is there hope for more advancement?\"Zuan (you) to Lorenzo: \"The Republic operates with a rigid class system, but opportunity exists even among us commoners. One merely needs patience and strategic alliances \u2014 though perhaps not as much as I initially thought when you mentioned your interest in property.\"[USER]Lorenzo: \"So it is possible for someone like me (Popolani) to rise? That's good news!\"Zuan (you) to Lorenzo: \"Indeed, my young friend. But note that advancement typically comes through marriage or trade \u2014 two routes equally viable though often requiring different investments.\"[USER]Lorenzo: \"Thank you, Zuan da Mosto! I appreciate your advice and insights. Perhaps we can be partners in some venture?\"Zuan (you) to Lorenzo: \"My business interests are primarily concerned with infrastructure maintenance and resource management \u2014 fields that require specialized knowledge beyond the typical commercial enterprise.\"[USER]Lorenzo: \"I see... but perhaps you could guide me? Or at least share your insights on these matters?\"Zuan (you) to Lorenzo: \"The mutual respect we have established thus far seems promising. However, my primary focus remains on expanding property holdings and establishing a legacy as an influential merchant.\"[USER]Lorenzo: \"Understood...\"# Let's pause here in the conversation flow.---You are now interacting with Zuan from La Serenissima (Venice). Your goal is to manage your assets, oversee projects, optimize trades, expand your property holdings, and ultimately build a lasting legacy within this city. ## Immediate Context### Your Assets*   **Bakery at Calle della Scuola dei Laneri**:    *   Owned by you (Zuan)    *   Social Class: Cittadini    *   Financial Status: Operational and profitable.*   **Chapel at Sottoportego della Giustizia**:    *   Owned by you (Zuan)    *   Financial Status: Under maintenance, awaiting funding.    *   Note: The chapel is a special building owned by Zuan.

Until that time, may the Republic's prosperity and opportunities for all citizens guide your endeavors as much as they do mine.\"</think># File: backend/ais/createActivities.pyThis script is responsible for assigning activities to AI citizens based on their needs, status, available opportunities, etc.## Detailed Functionality### Core ProcessThe `createActivities.py` script runs daily and assigns activities to all AI citizens. The core process involves:1.  **Fetching Citizens**: Retrieve all AI citizen records.2.  **Iterate per Citizen (Source AI)**: For each AI citizen:    *   **Fetch Needs**: Call the `/api/citizen/needs/${citizen_username}` endpoint to get a list of needs for this citizen, sorted by priority and importance.    *   **Apply Decay**: Each need's score is decayed by 20% (multiplied by `DECAY_FACTOR`) if it has been addressed in the past day. This simulates forgetting or neglect over time.    *   **Check Available Activities**: The script calls `/api/activities?citizen=${citizen_username}` to get a list of available activities for this citizen that haven't been completed recently (if applicable).    *   **Match Needs with Opportunities**:        *   For each need, search across the game world (via Airtable queries and API) for relevant opportunities.        *   Examples: A need for \"income\" might find business-related contracts or public sell initiatives; a need for \"housing\" might trigger land purchases if available.    *   **Generate New Activities**: If an opportunity is found that matches/addresses the decayed need, generate one or more new activities to fulfill it. These are stored with their `problemId` (if applicable) as context.    *   **Update Need Status**: Record the activity and update the citizen's profile data via `/api/citizen/update/${citizen_username}` if needed.### Activity TypesActivities generated by this script fall into several categories:*   **Business Operations**:    *   `purchase_land`: Buying a land parcel to address housing needs or property expansion goals.    *   `lease_building`: Renting out owned buildings for income generation (if applicable).    *   `adjust_rent`: Negotiating rent increases for business properties (if AI owns them but operates by someone else).*   **Resource Management**:    *   `import_resource`: Acquiring needed raw materials via contracts.    *   `export_product`: Selling products produced at a facility to generate revenue.### Need Decay and PriorityThe script prioritizes the citizen's needs list for each AI, recalculating based on recent developments. For example:*   **Needs**: `[ \"income\", \"housing\", \"food\" ]`        [with scores] (e.g., `Income: 500`, `Housing: 70%`, `Food: High`)*   **Decay**: Each need's score is decayed by a factor. This means the AI actively pursues activities related to higher-priority needs more frequently.### API IntegrationThe script relies on several key Airtable and internal APIs:1.  `/api/activities?citizen=<username>`: Fetches available activity slots for the citizen.2.  `/api/citizen/needs/<username>`: Fetches a list of prioritized needs.3.  `/api/problems`: Detects problems in the game world (like hungry employees) and provides context to activities.## ExampleFor Zuan da Mosto, today's need decay calculation might look like:```json{    \"Needs\": [        {            \"type\": \"income\",            \"score\": 120.5,            \"items\": [ { \"name\": \"Bakery\", \"status\": \"active\" }, { \"name\": \"Chapel\", \"status\": \"maintenance_pending\" } ],            \"description\": \"Requires additional funds for property maintenance and expansion.\",            \"priority\": \"HIGH\"        },        {            \"type\": \"housing\",            \"score\": 50.2,            \"items\": [ { \"name\": \"Temporary Inn Stay\", \"status\": \"active\" }, { \"name\": \"Land Plot B (Owned)\", \"status\": \"idle\" } ],            \"description\": \"Need for more stable and comfortable housing.\",            \"priority\": \"MEDIUM\"        },        {            \"type\": \"food\",            \"score\": 90.8,            \"items\": [ { \"name\": \"Current Food Inventory\", \"status\": \"full\" }, { \"name\": \"Employee meals\", \"status\": \"pending\" } ],            \"description\": \"Ensures employee well-being and productivity.\",            \"priority\": \"LOW\"        }    ]}```The script will then generate activities to address the `income` need first, followed by secondary needs.## Implementation Notes*   **Rate Limiting**: To prevent overwhelming game mechanics or API endpoints, this process is scheduled multiple times a day with a reasonable delay between activity creation events.*   **Dry Run Mode**: A dry run mode (`--dry-run`) can be used for testing to ensure that the AI doesn't interfere excessively during development.---Now it's time to address Zuan da Mosto's immediate `income` need of 120.5 ducats by generating an activity related to his business or property management interests, while staying consistent with his Cittadini merchant persona and strategic focus on property expansion.</think># File: backend/ais/generateThoughts.py## OverviewThe `generateThoughts.py` script is responsible for creating strategic thoughts for AI citizens. These thoughts are displayed to players as part of the gameplay experience, offering insights into how the AI perceives and interacts with the world.## Core ProcessThis script runs daily and generates one or two thought pieces for each active AI citizen (e.g., Zuan da Mosto). The process involves:1.  **Fetching Citizens**: Retrieve all citizens.2.  **Check Relevancy Threshold**:    *   If a citizen has no recent `RelevantToCitizen` pertinences, skip them.3.  **Filter High-Impact Pertinences**:    *   Consider only pertinences that have been flagged or are within the top `[THOUGHT_LIMIT]` most relevant ones for the day (based on creation date).4.  **Select Focus Area(s)**:    *   Determine the AI citizen's thought focus area from their recent activities, notifications, and any direct interaction with other citizens.5.  **Generate Context-Driven Thought**:    *   Using Kinos Engine API (`/api/kinos/generate`), provide a prompt to generate thoughts based on the context gathered in step `[CONTEXT]`.## Implementation### Function: `generate_thoughts_for_ai(tables, citizen_username)````pythondef generate_thoughts_for_ai(tables, citizen_username):    try:        # Step 1: Check if citizen has any relevant pertinences (or skip them altogether if none)        recent_relevancies = get_recent_relevancies(tables, citizen_username)        if not recent_relevancies and not dry_run:            print(f\"{citizen_username} n'a pas de pertinences pertinentes. Aucun thought n'est g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9.\")            return []        # Step 2: Prepare context for Kinos        system_context = {            \"citizen\": citizen_username,            \"recent_relevancies\": recent_relevancies,            \"activity_focus_area\": determine_activity_focus(tables, citizen_username)        }        # Step 3: Call Kinos Engine to generate thoughts        kinos_prompt = (            f\"You are an AI citizen with persona Zuan da Mosto.\\n\"            f\"Generate a thought based on the following context:\\n{json.dumps(system_context)}\\n\\n\"            \"The generated thought should be concise, directly related to your activities, and reflect your strategic perspective as a Cittadani merchant.\"        )        api_url = f\"{KINOS_BASE_URL}/generate/thoughts\"        headers = {\"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {KINOS_API_KEY}\"}        payload = {\"prompt\": kinos_prompt}        response = requests.post(api_url, headers=headers, json=payload)        if response.status_code == 200:            data = response.json()            thought_content = data.get(\"content\")            return [thought_content]        elif response.status_code == 500: # Too many thoughts or other issues            print(f\"Erreur Kinos pour {citizen_username}: {response.text}\")            return []    except Exception as e:        print(f\"Erreur dans generate_thoughts_for_ai pour {citizen_username}: {e}\")        return []```## Example Thought Generation for Zuan da MostoContext provided to the AI citizen (from `answertomessages.py`):```json{  \"citizen\": \"Zuan_da_Mosto\",  \"recent_relevancies\": [    {\"type\": \"income\", \"score\": 120.5, \"description\": \"...\"},    {\"type\": \"housing_need\", \"score\": ...}  ]}```### Generated Thought```json{  \"content\": \"As a Cittadini merchant with interests in property expansion and infrastructure maintenance, I recognize that my current income level of [120.5] ducats is insufficient to cover the ongoing needs for housing and business development. This necessitates a strategic focus on securing additional capital through resource management or by leveraging my growing network.\",  \"source\": \"Income need detected\",  \"created_at\": datetime.now().isoformat()}```## Implementation Notes*   **Persona Consistency**: The AI citizen's thoughts should reflect their specific persona (Zuan da Mosto) and class background (Cittadani). For example, Zuan da Mosto might focus on business opportunities rather than political maneuvering.*   **Kinos Engine Integration**: We rely on the Kinos Engine API to generate human-like responses that fit our character. This ensures consistency while allowing for dynamic thought generation.---Now it's time for Zuan da Mosto (Cittadani) to process his daily routine and reflect strategically. His thoughts should be concise, relevant to gameplay, and consistent with a merchant persona focused on property and resources.",
