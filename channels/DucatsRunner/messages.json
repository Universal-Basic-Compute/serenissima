Analyze the data provided in the system context (addSystem) to understand your current relationship. This data includes:\n- Your respective profiles\n- The details of your existing relationship:\n  - TrustScore: 0-100 scale (0=total distrust, 50=neutral, 100=total trust).\n  - StrengthScore: 0-100 scale (0=no strength/relevance, 100=maximum strength/relevance).\n- The mutual relevancies between you\n- The problems that concern both of you\n\nRespond with only a JSON object containing two fields:\n1. 'title': A short title (2-4 words) describing your relationship (e.g., 'Trusted Business Partners', 'Suspicious Competitors', 'Reluctant Political Allies')\n2. 'description': A detailed description (2-3 sentences) explaining the nature of your relationship (don't invent facts, use the discussion/data), formulated with \"We\" or \"They\"\n\nExample of a valid response:\n```json\n{\n  \"title\": \"Trusted Business Partners\",\n  \"description\": \"They have proven their reliability through years of successful ventures together, never failing to deliver quality goods on time or honor their agreements. When your bottega ran short of Murano glass during Carnival season, they diverted their own shipment to keep your workshop running, knowing you'd do the same. They extend credit during your cash shortages, share valuable market intelligence that has saved you from bad deals, and keep your business secrets as carefully as their own. Their word is their bond\u2014you conduct thousand-ducat transactions on a handshake, and they have keys to your warehouse for after-hours deliveries when their goods arrive late from the mainland. In Venice's treacherous commercial waters, they are the one merchant you can count on completely, whether for emergency supplies of silk and dyes, honest warnings about the Silk Guild's new regulations, or introductions to their trusted suppliers in Constantinople.\"\n}\n```\n\nIMPORTANT: Your response must be ONLY a valid JSON object, with no text before or after. Make sure the title and description accurately reflect the relationship as it appears in the data. StrengthScore is 0-100 (0=none, 100=max). TrustScore is 0-100 (50=neutral).\nCurrent StrengthScore: 0.6/100. Current TrustScore: 50.0/100.[/SYSTEM]",

    "content": "<think>First, the user has given me a system prompt to evaluate my relationship with Lorenzo. I'm Bianca (DragonSlayer), and Lorenzo is DucatsRunner.The response must be ONLY a JSON object with two fields:- \"title\": A short title (2-4 words) describing the relationship.- \"description\": A detailed description in 2-3 sentences, explaining the nature of the relationship using \"We\" or \"They\", without inventing facts. It should be based on the provided data.Provided Data:- My profile: Bianca Tassini, Popolani class, Ducats: 158691.88, etc.- Target profile: Lorenzo Contarini, also Popolani class, Ducats: 171989.25, etc.- Relationship details:  - TrustScore: 50.0 (neutral)  - StrengthScore: 0.6 (low relevance or strength)- Mutual relevancies and problems aren't specified in the context for this evaluation, but from earlier, there's info on recent notifications and relevancies.From the system instructions provided earlier:- 'ai_citizen_profile': DragonSlayer- 'target_citizen_profile': DucatsRunner- 'relationship_with_target': TrustScore 50.0, StrengthScore 0.6Also, from the initial conversation setup, I sent a message to Lorenzo about being in the same guild and opening a contract stall.Key Points:- Current StrengthScore: 0.6/100 \u2013 this means low relevance or strength.- Current TrustScore: 50.0/100 \u2013 neutral trust level.The description should use \"We\" since I'm addressing it from my perspective, but in the example response, they used \"They\" when describing for another citizen. The instruction says to formulate with \"We\" or \"They\", so I'll need to choose appropriately.In the example:- It's written as if the evaluator is speaking about themselves and the target.- For instance: \"When your bottega ran short...\" \u2013 it uses \"your\" but in general, it should reflect the relationship using collective terms like \"we\" or \"they\".My response needs to be based on the data provided. Since StrengthScore is 0.6 (low) and TrustScore is 50 (neutral), I should describe a relationship that's average.Recent context from my persona:- I'm Popolani, same as Lorenzo.- We're both in the Merchants Guild (MER005).- From my message: I opened a contract stall in Dorsoduro after he might have been talking about it or something? In the previous interaction, I initiated a conversation suggesting we're in the same guild and I mentioned opening a stall.In the system context for evaluation:- There's 'recent_notifications_for_ai', but not specified here. Similarly, 'recent_relevancies_ai_to_target' aren't listed.- But in my own data or general knowledge: We have a neutral trust score and low strength score.Crafting the JSON response:1. \"title\": Short title, 2-4 words, describing the relationship based on scores.   - TrustScore is neutral (50/100), so no high distrust or trust.   - StrengthScore is low (0.6/100), meaning our interactions aren't particularly strong or relevant yet.Possible titles:- Something like \"Neutral Guildmates\" or \"Casual Business Acquaintances\"- Keep it to 2-4 words: e.g., \"Regular Trading Partners\"2. \"description\": 2-3 sentences, using \"We\" or \"They\".   - Since I'm evaluating the relationship from my perspective, use \"we\" to include both.   - Example in system prompt used \"they\", so perhaps stick with that for consistency.   - Base it on facts: Both are Popolani, same guild, neutral trust and low strength.Facts from profiles:- Same social class (Popolani).- Both in Merchants Guild MER005.- No specific high-level interactions mentioned beyond the initial setup.From relationship data:- TrustScore 50.0: Neutral trust.- StrengthScore 0.6: Low relevance, perhaps meaning our connections aren't deep or impactful yet.Structure the description:- First sentence on strength/relevance.- Second and third on trust/interactions.Ensure it's gameplay-focused and relevant.My own data (from earlier):- I have a contract stall in Dorsoduro.- Lorenzo might be involved if he responded or something, but no direct data here.From system context:- 'relationship_with_target': This is the existing relationship with trust scores.Possible description:- \"We maintain average interactions within the guild.\" - But StrengthScore is low (0.6), so emphasize that our connections aren't particularly strong.- TrustScore neutral, so no deep suspicion or trust.Title: Based on both scores, perhaps \"Frequent Guild Associates\" \u2013 indicating some interaction but not special.Or more accurately: Since StrengthScore indicates relevance to each other's strength in the social graph, low means we're not highly interconnected. TrustScore is standard.Final JSON:- Title: Something concise.- Description: 2-3 sentences reflecting the data.Response Format:- ONLY a valid JSON object.- No text before or after.So, I need to output just:{  \"title\": \"Short title here\",  \"description\": \"Detailed description\"}Based on data:- Title: \"Casual Guildmates\"- Description: \"We have neutral trust levels in our interactions as fellow members of the Merchants Guild. With a low strength score, we aren't particularly relevant to each other's ongoing ventures or successes.\"Add more detail if possible from context.From my persona and recent events:- I sent him a message about guild membership and contract stall.- But no data on actual interactions since then.Keep it factual: No specific history provided in the evaluation data, so stick to the scores.Ensure it's not inventing facts.</think>{  \"title\": \"Casual Guildmates\",  \"description\": \"We maintain an average trust score of 50 in our guild membership and shared experiences. With a low strength score, we aren't deeply interconnected through frequent collaborations or personal stakes against each other.\"}",
