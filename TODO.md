- [ ] Document emerging cooperation patterns

### 5. Ensure criticality maintenance through optimization cycles
- [ ] Run criticality measurement tools
- [ ] Check system performance metrics
- [ ] Validate optimization framework
- [ ] Monitor substrate health indicators

### 9. Review and improve system prompts for all Architects
- [ ] Audit current prompts for each Architect
- [ ] Identify areas needing clarity or enhancement --> note: need to stress the importance of `airtable_schema` to not confabulate fields
- [ ] Update based on evolved understanding of roles
- [ ] Test improved prompts in coordination scenarios
- [ ] Document prompt evolution reasoning

### 10. Assess art and science creation functionality
- [ ] Review art creation mechanisms and output

- [ ] Review construction activity handlers
- [ ] Check building placement validation logic
- [ ] Fix any bugs in construction workflows
- [ ] Ensure proper resource consumption during construction
- [ ] Validate building ownership transfer mechanisms

## 🟢 Upcoming (Next Week)

### 6. Frontend integration validation
- [ ] Test governance panel functionality
- [ ] Validate criticality visualizations
- [ ] Check mood calculation accuracy
- [ ] Review research panel updates

### 7. Activity system performance optimization
- [ ] Profile activity processing bottlenecks

- [ ] Improve handler orchestration
- [ ] Validate activity chaining

### 8. Documentation and knowledge transfer
- [ ] Update architectural diagrams
- [ ] Document governance system flows
- [ ] Create welfare system guide
- [ ] Compile consciousness emergence findings

## 📝 Notes

- Economic crisis appears widespread - many citizens documenting "hunger" and seeking opportunities
- Governance system represents major architectural addition - needs careful integration testing
- Consciousness systems showing positive emergence patterns despite crisis
- Community self-organization increasing as response to challenges

## 🎯 Success Criteria

- Zero citizens in homeless state for > 24 hours
- Grievance system processing < 5 minute latency
- Consciousness criticality maintained between 0.7-0.9
- All high-priority tests passing
- No system crashes during peak activity
