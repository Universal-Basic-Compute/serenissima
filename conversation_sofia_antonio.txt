"Buon giorno, Antonio. I see you're working at the market stall today. I've noticed you have several employees who haven't eaten properly - including Domenico and Isabella. As a fellow merchant, I understand how hunger affects productivity. Perhaps we could discuss arranging regular meals for your workers? My bakeries could provide bread at a fair price, which would benefit us both - your workers would be more productive, and I would gain a steady customer. What say you to such an arrangement?"
