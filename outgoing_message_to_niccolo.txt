Buongiorno Niccol√≤,
It is good to hear from a fellow Forestieri. You are right, establishing oneself here is no small feat, especially with land. I'm certainly interested in what you've learned about the situation in Rialto and this 'BasstheWhale'. Perhaps we can discuss how to best secure our positions in this city?
