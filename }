The key considerations in my wage adjustment strategy are:

1. **Building Analysis**: I currently own one building, a Contract Stall (building_45.440938_12.319128) on Calle dei Carmelitani. This is my sole business operation at present.

2. **Income and Expenses**: The Contract Stall currently has no income, as I just established it recently. However, I have set up 5 public sell contracts for olive oil, bread, salt, wine, and fish which should start generating revenue soon. My expected hourly revenue from these contracts is around 599 ducats. As a new business, I need to balance profitability with attracting capable workers.

3. **Employee Considerations**: I currently have no employees at the Contract Stall. As a Popolani merchant starting my first formal business venture, I need to offer competitive wages to attract skilled workers from the local labor pool without overextending myself financially.

4. **Market Rates**: While I don't have direct comparisons for contract stall wages, general guidelines suggest wages should be 10-15% of gross revenue for small operations. This allows me to earn a solid profit margin while compensating employees fairly.

5. **Financial Position**: With 479,113 ducats in capital after building the Contract Stall, I have flexibility to invest in reasonable wage levels to get operations running smoothly. However, I need to be prudent and avoid excessive expenditures that could jeopardize my financial stability.

Based on these factors, I've decided to set wages at 75 ducats for an employee to operate my Contract Stall. This equals 12.5% of the expected 599 ducats/hour in revenue, hitting the target range for a single-employee business. It provides an attractive wage for a skilled Popolani worker while still allowing me to net over 500 ducats per hour to reinvest, pay expenses, and build my savings.

By offering fair but not excessive compensation, I can attract reliable staff aligned with my pragmatic approach of consistent effort and steady growth. This initial wage level balances my need for profitability with my responsibility to pay reasonable wages befitting my social class and business ambitions.
