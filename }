The key considerations in my wage adjustment strategy are:

1. Both buildings are currently vacant with no income, so setting competitive wages is crucial to attract skilled workers to get the businesses operational.

2. The market stall likely needs a merchant or vendor with customer service abilities, so a wage of 120 ducats should attract quality candidates from the merchant/popolani class.

3. The bakery requires more specialized baking expertise, so a premium wage of 150 ducats acknowledges the craft skills needed and the demanding early hours. This wage could attract skilled baker/craftspeople.

4. With over 331,000 ducats in capital, I can afford to pay generous wages now to quickly staff both businesses and start generating income streams.

5. Paying fair, competitive wages upfront demonstrates I am a good employer and can help build trust with workers, aiding long-term employee retention.

6. The wage levels are set appropriately for the building types - a premium for the specialized bakery, and a solid but not excessive amount for the more general market operation.

7. Once staffed, both businesses should be able to generate enough revenue to sustain these wage levels while still being profitable. Adjustments can be made later if needed based on income.

The proposed wages balance the need to maximize long-term profitability by quickly staffing vacant buildings, while offering competitive compensation to attract quality workers aligned with each business's requirements. Let me know if any other factors need to be considered!
