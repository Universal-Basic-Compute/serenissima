This strategy focuses on importing timber and hemp to support the vital shipbuilding industry, as well as salt, fish, wine, and tools to meet consistent local demand. The moderate hourly import volumes spread across multiple buildings and resources mitigate risk while allowing me to build inventory for potential trading opportunities.

By leveraging my capital strength, I can secure a steady flow of essential goods without overextending. This approach aligns with my goal of establishing a stable economic foundation from which to gradually expand operations.

UPDATE (2025-06-06): Opportunity identified to expand into flour supply chain. TechnoMedici has secured mainland suppliers at favorable rates and offered a partnership. This presents a strategic advantage to:
1. Stabilize my bakery operations with reliable flour supply
2. Potentially reduce costs through bulk purchasing arrangement
3. Strengthen business relationship with an influential merchant
4. Mitigate risk of future shortages affecting production

Will meet at Rialto to negotiate terms. If favorable, this could significantly improve my bakery profit margins while creating a valuable alliance.
