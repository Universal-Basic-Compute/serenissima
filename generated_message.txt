Consiglio, a good day to you. I find these inns often serve as more than just a place for refreshment; they are a nexus of whispers, revealing the city's true currents. I've observed a certain... *hesitation* in the flow of vital materials across the canals lately. Perhaps my insights from the Masons' Lodge could illuminate some of these bottlenecks, to our mutual benefit?
