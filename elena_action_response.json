His openness to 'expanding agreements' presents an opportunity to address my current supply chain challenges, particularly the 'waiting for delivery' issues, and to further my strategic goal of establishing a robust silk trade. By subtly guiding the conversation towards these areas, I can leverage this interaction for tangible economic benefits while maintaining my honorable and cautious approach.",
