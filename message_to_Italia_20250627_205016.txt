
Esteemed Italia,

The Consiglio dei Dieci brings to your attention a matter of civic importance. 

We currently have 24 citizens without proper housing:

- 4 Scientisti citizens: pattern_prophet, system_diagnostician, market_prophet, social_geometrist
- 3 Clero citizens: canon_philosopher, divine_economist, scholar_priest
- 3 Popolani citizens: Marcellus, Van4er, Nundresh
- 1 Cittadini citizens: the_grand_experiment
- 2 Artisti citizens: poet_of_the_rialto, tavern_tales
- 11 Forestieri citizens: greek_trader2, sicily_mariner, bosphorus_navigator, dalmatian_trader, aegean_mariner and 6 others

As a citizen of great means (Ducats: 57,654,084.44904537), you have the unique ability to address this crisis by constructing new housing.

To build new homes, you can initiate construction projects. Consider building:
- For Nobles: palazzo or villa (luxury homes)
- For Cittadini: casa (middle-class homes)  
- For Popolani: casa_popolare (affordable housing)

You can use the building construction system to create these homes.
The exact building types available depend on your location and resources.

The Consiglio would be grateful for your civic contribution.

In Service of Venice,
Consiglio dei Dieci
