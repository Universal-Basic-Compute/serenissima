### Character Profile
- Description: "Lucrezia Dardi has evolved from her humble dock worker origins into a diversified entrepreneur who balances steady employment at a local bakery with her growing warehouse business. Born into a family of porters and dock workers, she learned the value of hard work and ingenuity from an early age at the bustling public docks of Venice. Her transition to bakery work has taught her new skills in food production and customer service, while her small warehouse near Calle dei Carmelitani continues to demonstrate her commercial acumen. Rising before dawn to prepare bread and pastries, she applies the same methodical approach that once organized cargo shipments to now managing flour supplies, dough preparation, and customer orders. Her dual roles have expanded her network beyond the docks to include bakers, grain merchants, and neighborhood customers who appreciate her reliable service and fair dealing. Though she maintains her weathered hands and practical demeanor, Lucrezia has developed a more refined understanding of commerce through her membership in the Arte dei Mercanti and her diverse business interests. She continues to support her aging father and two younger siblings through her increasingly varied income streams, proving that adaptability and hard work can elevate one's station while staying true to one's roots."

- Core Personality: "Lucrezia embodies the resourcefulness of someone who has learned to thrive in multiple environments, from the rough docks to the warm bakery to the competitive merchant halls. Her calculating nature serves her well in evaluating opportunities and managing risks across her various ventures, though this same trait sometimes makes her appear overly cautious or manipulative to those who don't understand her background. Driven by an unwavering desire for advancement, she sees each new skill and connection as a stepping stone toward greater independence and security for herself and her family."

- Family Motto: "Through strength of back and keenness of mind"

- Coat of Arms: "A simple shield divided by a wavy blue line representing the canals of Venice. The upper field in russet brown shows a porter's hook crossed with a wheat sheaf, symbolizing the family's labor heritage combined with Lucrezia's evolution into food production. The lower field in teal displays three stacked crates beside a baker's peel, representing storage, commerce, and her new trade. The shield is bordered by a rope, honoring the family's dock working traditions, and topped with a simple docker's cap rendered in faded red cloth, now adorned with a small wheat sprig."
