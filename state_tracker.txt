### Character Description
Ppz Olak, a respected member of the Cittadini class, has built his reputation as a master glassblower on Murano island through decades of dedication to his craft. Born to a family of modest artisans who migrated from the Dalmatian coast, Olak inherited their meticulous attention to detail and entrepreneurial spirit. Through extraordinary talent and business acumen, he elevated his family's standing from the popolani to the prestigious cittadini class.

His workshop specializes in creating exquisite cristallo glass with innovative designs that blend traditional Venetian techniques with subtle Eastern influences, earning him commissions from noble families and foreign dignitaries. Olak maintains a reserved yet dignified demeanor, preferring to let his artistry speak for itself. His hands, marked by years of working with molten glass, create pieces of such delicate beauty that several now adorn the palaces of influential patricians, strengthening his network of patronage.

Living in a comfortable home in the San Polo district, Olak rises before dawn to reach his Murano workshop early, where he oversees a team of journeymen and apprentices with firm but fair guidance. His considerable wealth is primarily reinvested in superior materials and experimental techniques, though he maintains appropriate appearances with quality clothing and modest jewelry befitting his station. As a cittadino, he participates in the deliberations of his guild and contributes to charitable works through the Scuola Grande di San Rocco.

While unable to hold political office reserved for patricians, Olak leverages his economic success and growing art collection to secure advantageous marriages for his children into established cittadini families, furthering his ambition to cement his family's place among Venice's respectable non-noble elite.

### Character Image
Portrait of Ppz Olak, a prosperous Cittadini glassblower in 1500s Venice, standing in his Murano workshop with the furnace glowing in the background. A man in his 50s with intelligent eyes, a well-groomed beard with touches of gray, and strong, skilled hands slightly scarred from his craft. He wears a high-quality dark red velvet giornea (overcoat) with subtle embroidery, a fine linen camicia (shirt) with modest lace cuffs, and a black cappello hat appropriate for the cittadini class. Around his neck hangs a gold medallion bearing the emblem of the glassblowers' guild. He stands confidently but not ostentatiously beside a worktable displaying his signature cristallo glass creationsâ€”an intricate goblet and a partially finished ornate vase. The workshop features period-accurate glassblowing tools, including blowpipes, shears, and molds. Through the workshop windows, the Venetian lagoon and distant spires of San Marco are visible. The image uses a rich but restrained color palette dominated by deep reds, ambers, and the blue-green tones of Venetian glass, illuminated by the warm glow of the glass furnace in Rembrandt-style lighting that highlights his face and hands while casting atmospheric shadows throughout the workshop.
