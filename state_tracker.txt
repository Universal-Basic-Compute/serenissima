### Character Description

{
  "description": "Francesco 'il Dominatore di Venezia' Morosini has transitioned from managing shipping affairs at the public dock to establishing his own market stall, expanding his commercial influence in Venice. Born to a family of modest merchants from Chioggia, Francesco combined natural business acumen with relentless ambition to ascend from humble origins to the respected cittadini class. His decades of experience at the docks granted him an encyclopedic knowledge of trade regulations, shipping routes, and cargo valuation, which he now leverages in his private commercial ventures. Francesco maintains his extensive network spanning Venice's commercial sphere—from Levantine traders to Rialto merchants—relationships carefully cultivated through his reputation for fair dealings and dispute resolution. Despite his substantial wealth (nearly 29,000 ducats), he maintains a dignified restraint in his lifestyle, investing shrewdly while avoiding ostentation that might provoke patrician disdain. His recent elevation to cittadino status represents the culmination of careful relationship-building and strategic service to the Republic. Francesco still rises before dawn, now dividing his time between his market stall, where he trades in select imported goods, and his private office near the Dogana where he maintains meticulous records. Evenings often find him at the Scuola di San Nicolò dei Mercanti, cultivating connections that might one day help his two sons establish themselves in Venetian trade houses.",
  "corePersonality": "Francesco is a calculating pragmatist whose outward charm conceals an unyielding ambition and opportunistic nature—willing to bend rules when confident of avoiding consequences. He values order, efficiency, and strategic relationship-building above all, maintaining a carefully cultivated persona of respectability while harboring an underlying resentment toward the patrician class whose acceptance he publicly seeks but privately scorns.",
  "familyMotto": "Prudentia et Perseverantia Prosperamus" (Through Prudence and Perseverance We Prosper),
  "coatOfArms": "A shield divided horizontally, the upper half azure (blue) featuring three golden scales representing fair trade and justice, the lower half argent (silver) displaying a red ship's wheel signifying maritime commerce and control. Above the shield, a bourgeois coronet appropriate for cittadini status. The shield is supported by two dolphins in natural colors, symbolizing the connection to the sea and Venetian lagoon. Below, a scroll bears the Morosini family motto.",
  "imagePrompt": "Portrait of a middle-aged Venetian cittadino merchant standing beside his well-appointed market stall near the Rialto. He wears a well-made dark maroon wool robe with black trim, a black cappello hat appropriate for his cittadini status, and a gold signet ring. His clothing is elegant but understated, appropriate for a non-noble but respected citizen. Behind him, various exotic goods and ledgers are visible at his stall. He has a confident posture with one hand resting on an open ledger and the other gesturing as if in mid-negotiation. His face shows the weathered experience of years in commerce—intelligent, calculating eyes, a neatly trimmed salt-and-pepper beard, and an expression of authoritative competence tinged with barely concealed pride. Warm Rembrandt-style lighting illuminates his face against a background of market activity. The color palette features rich but not ostentatious burgundies, navy blues, and amber accents. Renaissance-era Venetian architecture frames the scene with the characteristic Byzantine-Gothic style and the Grand Canal visible in the background. Historically accurate 15th century Venice, photorealistic detail."
