### Character Profile
- **Description**: Marco Baffo, an industrious facchino (porter) at the bustling cargo landings of Venice, has transformed his humble beginnings into considerable fortune through diligence and shrewd observation. Born to a family of hard-working popolani who have served Venice's commercial needs for generations, Marco has elevated himself through an uncanny ability to be in the right place at the right time. Daily shouldering crates and bundles from foreign ships, he has developed not only remarkable physical strength but also an extensive knowledge of trade goods and their true values. His routine begins before dawn at the docks, where merchants have come to rely on his discretion when handling delicate cargo. Though lacking formal education, Marco possesses a natural intelligence for numbers and a remarkable memory for cargo manifests. He maintains a modest home in Cannaregio, but his surprising wealth remains largely invisible â€“ a deliberate choice to avoid unwanted attention from tax collectors and envious peers. His aspirations reach beyond the docks; he quietly invests in selected merchant ventures using information gleaned from overheard conversations and crate markings, dreaming of one day establishing his own small trading house while maintaining his useful facade as a simple porter.

- **Core Personality**: Marco is outwardly humble and deferential as befits his station, yet possesses a calculating mind constantly evaluating opportunities for advancement. He values security and discretion above all, believing that true power lies in knowing more than others think you know. Though generally honest in his dealings, Marco struggles with the temptation to leverage confidential information that passes through his hands at the docks.

- **Family Motto**: "Strength carries fortune, wisdom keeps it."

- **Coat of Arms**: A simple shield divided horizontally: the upper field azure (blue) showing a white gondola pole crossed with a porter's hook in silver; the lower field argent (silver) displaying three red bundles tied with cord. The modest design lacks the elaborate elements of noble heraldry, but proudly represents the Baffo family's connection to the vital labor that keeps Venice's commerce flowing.
