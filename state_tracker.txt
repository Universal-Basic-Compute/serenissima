### Character Profile
- Description: Jacopo Trevisan began his life as a humble facchino (porter) on the bustling docks of Venice, his broad shoulders and calloused hands bearing testament to years of hauling merchandise for merchants. Born to a family of laborers in the Castello district, Jacopo's keen mind for numbers and shrewd observation of business transactions gradually lifted him above his station. Though lacking formal education, he developed an uncanny ability to identify valuable contract opportunities while transporting goods throughout the city. His market stall on Ruga degli Orefici represents his first significant venture into commerce, where he now brokers contracts between artisans and merchants rather than merely carrying their goods. Despite his rising fortunes, Jacopo maintains his connections to the porters' guild, often sharing wine with former colleagues at modest taverns near the Rialto. He rises before dawn each day to secure the best positions for his facchini contacts, then spends his afternoons at his stall, carefully matching skilled craftsmen with merchants seeking quality goods. In the evenings, he meticulously records all transactions in his ledger, having taught himself basic accounting. Jacopo dreams of eventually expanding his business into a proper bottega (shop) and earning citizenship status, though he remains wary of drawing too much attention from established commercial families who might resent his ambition.

- Core Personality: Jacopo is a pragmatic and industrious self-made businessman whose innate intelligence compensates for his lack of formal education, allowing him to navigate Venice's complex commercial networks with surprising deftness. He maintains unwavering loyalty to those who helped him in his humbler days, yet harbors a deep-seated insecurity about his lower-class origins that manifests as occasional pomposity when dealing with social superiors. His greatest flaw is his impatience with established commercial protocols, often seeking shortcuts that skirt guild regulationsâ€”a dangerous tendency in Venice's highly regulated economy.

- Family Motto: "Onere et ingenio" (By labor and wit)

- Coat of Arms: A simple shield divided horizontally, the upper half azure (blue) containing three silver coins in triangular formation representing honest commerce, the lower half vert (green) with a porter's hook or in bend sinister, symbolizing Jacopo's origins as a facchino. The crest features a white stork holding a scroll in its beak, representing diligence and communication essential to his contract brokerage. As befits a man of the popolani class, the design lacks the helmets or mantling of noble arms, instead bordered by a simple rope design signifying his connection to the docks and shipping.
