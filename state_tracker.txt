## Character Profile
- **Description**: Taddeo Crivelli, a weathered facchino with calloused hands and a sturdy frame built from years of hauling goods at Venice's bustling public docks. Born to a family of porters who have served the Republic for generations, Taddeo inherited not only his father's profession but also his sharp eye for valuable cargo and merchant connections. While lacking formal education, he possesses an intuitive understanding of trade flows and commercial relationships gleaned from years observing merchant transactions. Recently, Taddeo has shrewdly invested his hard-earned savings in a small warehouse near the docks, elevating himself slightly above his fellow porters. He rises before dawn each day to secure prime positions at the busiest landing areas, works tirelessly until midday, then spends afternoons managing his warehouse operations. Despite his humble origins, Taddeo dreams of expanding his nascent storage business into a modest commercial empire, perhaps one day earning citizenship for his descendants. His reputation for reliability among merchants and sailors—combined with his unparalleled knowledge of Venice's labyrinthine cargo routes—has made him an indispensable fixture in the maritime trading network of La Serenissima.

- **Core Personality**: Taddeo is a pragmatic opportunist with unwavering determination, viewing every interaction as a potential stepping stone toward greater prosperity while maintaining the steadfast reliability that has become his trademark at the docks. His outward humility masks a calculating mind constantly evaluating how to leverage his position between Venice's economic classes to maximum advantage, though he remains genuinely loyal to those who treat him fairly.

- **Family Motto**: "With Strength and Cunning We Rise"

- **Coat of Arms**: A simple shield divided diagonally, the upper left field azure (blue) representing the waters of Venice, the lower right field argent (silver) symbolizing honest labor. At center, a stylized porter's hook or in natural wood color crossed with a golden key, representing Taddeo's profession and his ambition to unlock greater opportunities. The crest features a silver heron standing vigilant, symbolizing patience and hard work near the water. No elaborate mantling or supporters, as befits a commoner's modest heraldic device.

- **Image Prompt**: Renaissance Venetian portrait of Taddeo Crivelli, a muscular middle-aged dock worker (facchino) with weathered skin, standing near Venice's public docks with cargo and ships visible in background. He wears simple dark brown wool trousers, a faded red linen shirt with rolled-up sleeves, a practical leather vest, and a coarse cap. His expression shows quiet determination and watchfulness. Strong sunlight illuminates his face, highlighting his calculating eyes and prematurely lined features. He stands with one hand resting on a porter's hook, the other gesturing toward a small warehouse. His posture suggests physical strength combined with merchant-like awareness. The color palette is earthy and modest with touches of Venetian mercantile blue in the background water. Photorealistic, detailed textures, historically accurate 15th century Venetian dock scene.
