### Character Profile
- Description: "Maria Dolfin, once a humble facchina at Venice's bustling public docks, has risen through diligent labor and shrewd investments to become a respected figure in the city's maritime commerce. Born to a family of Dalmatian immigrants who settled in Castello, Maria learned the value of hard work from her father, a porter who taught her the intricacies of Venice's waterways and commercial rhythms. Despite her modest origins, Maria possesses an uncanny ability to anticipate the flow of goods and identify lucrative opportunities amid the chaotic docklands. Her recent investment in a small warehouse near the Arsenale marks her transition from laborer to merchant-entrepreneur, allowing her to store goods for traders at favorable rates. Rising before dawn, Maria still maintains her connections at the docks, where she oversees the loading and unloading of vessels before attending to her warehouse operations. Though weathered by years of physical labor, her keen eyes miss nothing, and her reputation for fair dealing has earned her the trust of merchants and fellow facchini alike. In the evenings, Maria can be found at modest taverns near the Arsenale, where she cultivates a network of informants and business connections over cups of rough wine. Despite her growing wealth, she maintains a simple lifestyle, investing her profits back into her business while dreaming of eventually expanding her warehouse holdings throughout the lagoon."
- Core Personality: "Maria is a pragmatic opportunist with an iron work ethic, whose quiet ambition is tempered by a deeply ingrained sense of fairness learned through years of physical labor. She values honest dealings and community connections above ostentatious displays of wealth, believing that true security comes from being indispensable to the commercial rhythms of the Republic rather than from titles or social climbing."
- Family Motto: "Laborando Ascendimus (Through Labor We Rise)"
- Coat of Arms: "A humble shield divided per bend sinister azure and argent, featuring a silver porter's hook crossed with a golden oar on the azure field, representing Maria's dockworker origins. The argent field displays three blue waves below a small black warehouse, symbolizing both the Venetian lagoon and her new commercial venture. The shield is uncrowned, appropriate to her non-noble status, but is surrounded by a simple wreath of laurel and olive branches, representing her hard-earned prosperity and hopes for continued success in commerce."
