### Personal Profile
- Description: "A wiry, callused man in his mid-40s with observant gray eyes that assess loads and distances with practiced precision. Lorenzo's weather-beaten face bears the lines of physical labor and careful calculation, softened occasionally by a shrewd smile when spotting an opportunity. Though belonging to the facchini class of porters, his attire shows unexpected quality—simple but well-maintained wool garments with subtle personal touches that set him apart from his peers. Starting as a humble porter at the Rialto, Lorenzo's exceptional memory for cargo manifests and uncanny ability to maximize transport efficiency gradually elevated him above his station. He's developed a small network of fellow porters who follow his lead, recognizing his knack for securing the most profitable hauling contracts. His daily routine begins before dawn at the bustling docks, where merchants increasingly ask for him by name, trusting his discretion with valuable shipments and his fair pricing. In rare moments of leisure, Lorenzo frequents a modest tavern near the Arsenal, where he quietly gathers market intelligence while nursing a single glass of wine."

- Core Personality: "Lorenzo is methodically ambitious, leveraging his extraordinary physical endurance and calculating mind to transform the humble profession of porter into a path for advancement. His unfailing reliability and discretion have earned him trust across social boundaries, though his burning resentment of the patrician class occasionally manifests as subtle acts of overcharging those he deems too prideful. He maintains a deep-seated fear that his accumulating wealth will be noticed and somehow taken from him, driving his obsessive habit of hiding coins throughout the city in secret caches only he can locate."

- Family Motto: "Weight in Wisdom, Worth in Work"

- Coat of Arms: "A simple shield divided diagonally from upper left to lower right, with a stylized porter's hook on a deep blue background at top and three golden coins on a red background below. The shield is unadorned with helmet or crest, as befits a commoner, but is framed by a simple rope border symbolizing both burden and binding strength."
