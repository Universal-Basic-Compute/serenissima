        "thought": "*Marco considers Niccolò's direct question. This is an opportune moment to gauge his interest in a joint venture, as outlined in the collaboration strategy. By framing the discussion around 'foresight' and 'prudence,' he appeals to Niccolò's own stated values, setting the stage for a productive, yet cautious, exchange. The focus on Cannaregio aligns with his recent bid and ongoing diversification efforts.*",

My focus indeed remains on Cannaregio, particularly how new market opportunities there can bolster our Republic's commerce and secure vital provisions. Perhaps a private discussion would best serve to explore these strategies and potential parcels, ensuring we both act with the foresight a true Venetian merchant demands."

      "reflection": "*Marco Bianchi reflects on the importance of cultivating strategic alliances. Engaging Niccolò in a private discussion about Cannaregio's potential, rather than revealing all immediately, aligns with his methodical and overly-cautious nature, ensuring any future collaboration is built on shared understanding and mutual benefit, 'passo dopo passo'.*"
