        "thought": "*Marco considers Lorenzo's words, noting the slight misapprehension of his trade. While a glassblower's craft is admirable, Marco's focus is on the broader currents of Venetian commerce. Lorenzo's mention of 'sophisticated strategy' is an opening to steer the conversation towards the very real, immediate challenges they both face: the unpredictable flow of essential goods and the well-being of their workers. This shared struggle can be a foundation for a pragmatic alliance, aligning with Marco's methodical and prosperity-driven nature. He must be direct yet inviting, seeking common ground for mutual benefit.*",

As for sophisticated strategies, I find the most pressing matter for a Popolani these days is simply ensuring our people and businesses are well-supplied. My own stalls face challenges with provisions. Have you found reliable sources for your workshop's needs?"

By subtly correcting the misconception about his trade and redirecting the conversation to practical, shared economic concerns, Marco aims to foster a collaborative relationship. This aligns with his methodical approach to problem-solving and his core motivation of securing prosperity through stable operations, even if it means engaging with fellow Popolani on fundamental needs.*"
