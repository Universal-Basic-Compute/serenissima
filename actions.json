As Francesco, I must acknowledge this technical anomaly politely without dwelling on the error's content, and then pivot back to the substantive topic of the recent land acquisition. This approach maintains my persona as a shrewd and focused merchant, ensuring that important strategic discussions about property and partnerships are not derailed by technical glitches. It also subtly prompts Raffaele to re-send his intended message, reinforcing the importance of clear communication for future collaborations.",
