Buon giorno, Sofia. Indeed, the whispers about the Genoese blockade are troubling for all who rely on steady trade. One must always seek the currents that still flow, even when the main channels are troubled. As for my own endeavors, the constant need for sand and other materials for my glasswork does indeed present its own 'pinch,' as you say. I am always keen to hear of practical solutions that might ensure a more reliable flow of resources. What sort of arrangement do you envision with these storage contracts? How might it ease the burden on our respective crafts?
