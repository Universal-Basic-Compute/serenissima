Niccol√≤, rumors are as plentiful as pigeons in San Marco, but my mind is more on the *real* vexations. These whispers of new trade regulations I mentioned... they seem to be already tightening the flow of goods. My stalls are struggling to get basic provisions like flour and fish. As a man who sees patterns in the city's workings, have you found a way to navigate these new currents, or perhaps a shortcut around them?
