Bianca, good to see you. My affairs are never truly settled, always navigating new currents. But I've heard of your own recent trials. A stable roof and a full belly are paramount. Perhaps there's a way our paths might align, for my stalls are ever in need of diligent hands, and I value a keen eye for opportunity.
