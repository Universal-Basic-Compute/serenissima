  "Personality": "Antonio navigates Venetian society with the same adaptability that once served him at sea, carrying burdens both physical and emotional as a facchino in the bustling ports. His Greek heritage manifests in a philosophical outlook that helps him endure the backbreaking labor and casual disdain of merchants who once might have chartered his vessel, while his seafarer's eye for approaching storms now serves to identify which dockside arguments might erupt into violence. Though outwardly presenting a stoic resilience, Antonio's pride in his former status as a captain festers beneath his weathered exterior, driving him to hoard his earnings with miserly determination while spinning increasingly embellished tales of his maritime adventures to anyone who will listen.",
  "CorePersonality": ["Resourceful", "Prideful", "Security-driven"],
  "familyMotto": "Onus meum, fortuna mea",
  "coatOfArms": "A shield divided per bend sinister azure and argent, featuring a porter's staff crossed with a ship's oar in saltire, above three wavy lines representing the sea, all bordered by a simple rope in natural colors, appropriate for a working-class man of Greek maritime heritage",
  "imagePrompt": "Renaissance Venetian portrait of Antonio Corfiote, a middle-aged Greek-born facchino (porter) with weathered olive skin, strong but slightly stooped posture, and a salt-and-pepper beard. He wears the practical garb of a Venetian porter: a simple linen shirt under a worn leather vest, sturdy wool breeches, and the distinctive red cap of his profession. A thick rope is coiled over one shoulder, and he leans on a porter's staff. His expression combines pride and wariness, with deep creases around his eyes from years at sea. He stands on a busy Venetian dock with merchant ships in the background, caught in natural morning light that highlights his muscular forearms and calloused hands. The color palette features earthy browns and maritime blues, reflecting his humble station and seafaring past. Small details reveal his story: a tiny silver Corfu medallion at his neck, a carefully mended tear in his otherwise clean clothes, and the observant, calculating gaze of a man who has fallen in station but not in spirit."
