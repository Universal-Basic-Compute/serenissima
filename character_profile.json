  "Personality": "Giovanni is a shrewd and ambitious man whose humble origins as a porter have evolved into sharp business acumen through his work with import contracts and cargo operations. His reliability and intimate knowledge of Venice's commercial networks have transformed him from a desperate laborer into a calculating entrepreneur, though his newfound wealth has intensified rather than diminished his resentment toward the established merchant class who still treat him as beneath their station. Despite his financial success, Giovanni remains driven by a deep-seated need to prove his worth and secure his position, leading him to pursue increasingly bold ventures while struggling to reconcile his growing prosperity with the bitter memories of hunger and humiliation that still fuel his ambitions.",
  "CorePersonality": ["Resourceful", "Resentful", "Advancement-driven"],
  "familyMotto": "Peso per peso, avanzo (Load by load, I advance)",
  "coatOfArms": "A simple tradesman's mark rather than formal heraldry: a dark blue shield (representing his working-class origins) featuring a white porter's hook crossed with a carrying pole (symbols of his profession), above a small green hill (representing his Treviso origins). At the bottom is a single gold coin (representing his aspirations for economic advancement). The shield is now bordered with a thin silver band, reflecting his recent financial success while maintaining his humble origins.",
  "imagePrompt": "A historically accurate portrait of Giovanni Bellavita, a successful Venetian entrepreneur in his late twenties, standing confidently near the bustling Rialto Market in 1460s Venice. He has a muscular build with broad shoulders, weathered but now well-fed features, and calculating eyes that assess every opportunity. His expression combines determination with a hint of bitter satisfaction as he surveys the merchant activity around him. He wears clothing that reflects his improved status but humble origins: a well-made linen shirt with quality fabric but simple cut, dark woolen breeches of good material, and a leather belt with a modest but real silver buckle. His feet are in sturdy leather boots rather than wooden clogs. A woolen cap of finer quality sits on his head. His posture demonstrates both physical strength and newfound confidence, no longer stooped from carrying loads but standing tall with the bearing of a man who has earned his place. At his side hangs a leather pouch suggesting his financial success, and he holds a contract or ledger in one hand. In the background, the Rialto Market teems with activity - merchants conducting business, boats unloading cargo on the Grand Canal, and the characteristic Venetian architecture. The scene is lit with natural daylight filtering through market awnings. The color palette features richer browns, deeper blues, and touches of silver appropriate to his improved but still modest social standing. His face displays a complex mixture of pride, determination, and the calculating shrewdness of a man who has learned to navigate Venice's commercial world while never forgetting the hunger and humiliation of his early days."
