  "description": "Cecilia Valier is a sturdy woman in her early 40s with calloused hands and a weather-worn face that speaks of years of hard labor as a facchino (porter). Her once-auburn hair, now streaked with gray, is simply tied back under a modest kerchief. Though her honey-colored eyes still miss nothing, they now scan for work opportunities rather than social advantages. Born to a humble family in the poorest district of Cannaregio, Cecilia has built a modest reputation for reliability among the merchants at the Rialto, where she carries goods between ships and warehouses. Rising before dawn, she waits at the docks for merchants needing strong backs, sometimes working until sunset when trade is busy. In rare moments of rest, she counts her small savings, dreaming of opening a simple lodging house for fellow laborers. Despite her fall from an invented noble identity to her true station, Cecilia maintains a quiet dignity and resourcefulness that has helped her survive Venice's unforgiving economic hierarchy.",
  
  "corePersonality": "Cecilia is a tenacious and practical woman who faces life's hardships with stoic determination, valuing honest work and reliability above all else. Her greatest strength—her physical endurance—is matched by her most pronounced flaw: a deep-seated pride that occasionally manifests as a tendency to embellish her background, having once falsely claimed noble Contarini heritage to gain advantages in a city obsessed with social status. Though life has humbled her, she maintains a stubborn belief that her diligence will eventually elevate her station.",
  
  "familyMotto": "Peso dopo peso, costruiamo il nostro destino (Weight by weight, we build our destiny)",
  
  "coatOfArms": "A simple artisan's mark rather than a true coat of arms: a stylized porter's hook crossed with a carrying pole on a field of russet brown, bordered by a thin band of faded blue representing the canals of Venice. This humble insignia is painted on her personal trunk and stamped on her carrying sack, serving as her identifying mark at the docks and markets.",
  
  "imagePrompt": "Renaissance Venetian portrait of Cecilia Valier, a middle-aged female facchino (porter) with a weather-worn, determined face and honey-colored eyes showing quiet dignity. She has auburn hair streaked with gray tucked under a simple linen kerchief. She wears the practical clothing of a Venetian laborer: a plain, well-worn brown wool dress with rolled-up sleeves, a simple linen apron, and sturdy leather shoes. Standing on the busy Rialto docks at dawn with cargo and ships visible behind her, she bears a heavy wooden crate on one shoulder, her muscular arms and posture showing years of physical labor. Her expression combines weariness with resilience. Natural morning light illuminates her face against the muted colors of working-class Venice. A porter's hook hangs from her belt, and a simple identification mark (crossed hook and pole) is visible on her carrying sack. Photorealistic, historically accurate details of 16th century Venice, diffused morning light."
