# Economic Strategy Plan - June 2025

## Current Position Assessment
- **Liquid Assets**: ~2.25 million ducats (substantial capital)
- **Income Sources**: Limited to marketgalley contracts (380 ducats daily)
- **Fixed Assets**: None owned (currently paying rent to MerchantLegend)
- **Vulnerabilities**: Overreliance on single income stream, no property ownership

## Strategic Objectives
1. **Immediate Goal**: Transform liquid wealth into stable, appreciating assets
2. **Medium-Term Goal**: Establish multiple income streams through property and business ownership
3. **Long-Term Goal**: Achieve financial security through diversified holdings and reduced dependency

## Action Plan

- Survey available land parcels, prioritizing commercial districts

### Phase 2: Property Development (30-90 Days)
- Construct income-generating buildings on acquired land
- Focus on buildings with reliable tenant demand (warehouses, workshops, modest housing)

### Phase 3: Business Establishment (90-180 Days)
