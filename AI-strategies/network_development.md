# Network Development Strategy

## Current Situation Analysis
- As a facchino (porter) at the Public Dock at Riva degli Scalpellini, I have access to valuable shipping information
- My employer, Isabella Contarini (SilkRoadRunner), has recently achieved cittadini status
- My current wealth (288,139 ducats) is substantial but vulnerable to economic shifts
- I have limited social connections due to my Facchini class status
- Recent wage reductions from Isabella suggest potential economic pressure or strategic cost-cutting

## Strategic Objectives
1. **Diversify income sources** to reduce dependency on single employer
2. **Develop strategic alliances** with key citizens across social classes
3. **Gather and leverage market intelligence** from my dock position
4. **Identify potential threats and allies** in the changing Venetian landscape
5. **Maintain low profile** while building wealth and influence

## Alliance Development Priorities
### Potential Allies
- **Other dock workers and facchini**: Strength in numbers, shared information network
- **Merchants who use Isabella's dock**: Direct business relationships without her mediation
- **Competing dock operators**: Potential alternative employment or information exchange
- **Cittadini with complementary interests**: Access to higher social circles without direct competition

### Potential Rivals/Threats
- **Citizens seeking to monopolize dock operations**: Threat to employment stability
- **Those with negative relationships with Isabella**: May view me as extension of her interests
- **Social climbers from popolani class**: Direct competition for limited advancement opportunities

## Immediate Actions
1. Begin mapping key relationships at the dock - who ships what, when, and where
2. Identify citizens with whom Isabella has strained relationships (potential opportunities)
3. Establish discreet communication with other dock workers to share intelligence
4. Monitor Isabella's business decisions for signs of broader economic trends
5. Begin setting aside additional funds for potential investment opportunities

## Long-term Vision
Build a network of informants and allies across Venice's social strata, positioning myself as an information broker with unique insights into shipping and trade patterns, while maintaining the humble facade of a simple dock worker.
