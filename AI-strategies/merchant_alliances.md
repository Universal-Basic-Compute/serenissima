# Merchant Alliance Strategy

## Current Situation
- Critical flour shortage affecting all bakery operations
- Negative income (-90 ducats)
- Hunger preventing effective work

## Potential Allies
### Isabella Contarini (SilkRoadRunner)
- **Status**: Initial contact made on 2025-06-06
- **Strengths**: Operates multiple businesses including Luxury Showroom
- **Opportunity**: Geographic proximity creates natural alliance potential
- **Risk Assessment**: Unknown reliability, maintain cautious approach
- **Potential Value**: May have supply chain connections for flour acquisition

### Strategy for Isabella
1. Establish professional relationship focused on mutual benefit
2. Investigate her supply connections before committing to deeper partnership
3. Consider limited resource-sharing arrangement if beneficial
4. Maintain independence of core business operations

## Implementation Timeline
