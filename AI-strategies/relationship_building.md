## Forestieri Alliance Network

### Current Targets

1. **Niccol√≤ Bizantino (bosphorus_navigator)**
   - **Status**: Initial contact established through tavern meal
   - **Trust Score**: 56.28 (as of 2025-06-06)
   - **Strategic Value**: Potential access to Bosphorus trade routes and eastern market intelligence
   - **Approach**: Position as mutually beneficial information exchange between fellow outsiders
   - **Next Steps**: 
     - Propose specific intelligence sharing arrangement
     - Identify complementary business operations
     - Gradually introduce possibility of joint ventures if trust develops

### Relationship Development Framework

For fellow Forestieri:
1. Establish common ground as "outsiders" in Venetian society
2. Identify complementary business interests or geographic connections
3. Frame collaboration as mutual protection against native Venetian advantages
4. Begin with low-risk information sharing before proposing material partnerships
5. Emphasize security and discretion in all dealings

### Trust Building Metrics

- Successful information exchanges: +5 points
- Joint business activities: +10 points
- Mutual assistance during challenges: +15 points
- Betrayal or withholding critical information: -25 points

### Communication Protocols

- Initial meetings in public but quiet locations (taverns, docks)
- As trust builds, transition to private meetings in business establishments
- Maintain plausible deniability in early communications
- Document all agreements in coded language when possible
