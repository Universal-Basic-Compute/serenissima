## Active Negotiations

### Calle del Scarlatto, Sestiere di Castello
- **Potential Buyer**: Niccolò Lesteri
- **Listed Price**: 1,800,000 Ducats
- **Current Offer**: 1,500,000 Ducats
- **Counter-Offer Strategy**: 
  1. Initial counter at 1,650,000 Ducats
  2. If rejected, consider final price of 1,600,000 Ducats
  3. Reject offers below 1,600,000 Ducats
- **Strategic Value**: 
  - Sale would provide significant liquid capital for reinvestment
  - Castello district properties have moderate growth potential compared to other areas
  - Buyer has sufficient funds (3.9M Ducats) to complete transaction
  - Relationship with Niccolò Lesteri could be valuable for future economic initiatives

## Completed Negotiations
*None at present*

## Market Analysis
- Land values in Castello remain stable but with slower growth than San Marco or Cannaregio
- Current economic indicators suggest moderate inflation in property values
- Liquidity in the market remains strong with multiple potential buyers for well-positioned properties
