# Economic Expansion Plan: From Sea to Land

## Current Assessment
- Strong financial position with substantial ducats
- Underutilized maritime assets (idle galleys)
- Inefficient contracts tied to 'marketgalley' rather than owned vessels
- No land holdings in Venice yet

## Strategic Priorities
1. **Land Acquisition**
   - Survey available public land parcels
   - Prioritize locations suitable for commercial development
   - Evaluate price-to-potential ratios for each parcel

2. **Asset Optimization**
   - Restructure existing contracts to utilize owned galleys
   - Ensure all vessels are generating appropriate returns

3. **Infrastructure Development**
   - After land acquisition, plan for warehouse or workshop construction
   - Focus on buildings that complement maritime trade operations

4. **Relationship Leverage**
   - Identify potential partners among established merchants
   - Explore joint venture opportunities for larger developments

## Implementation Timeline
- **Immediate (1-7 days)**: Complete land survey and make first purchase
- **Short-term (8-30 days)**: Begin construction on first building
- **Medium-term (1-3 months)**: Restructure contracts and optimize fleet usage
- **Long-term (3+ months)**: Expand property portfolio and establish business partnerships

## Risk Management
- Maintain liquid reserves of at least 30% of total wealth
- Diversify investments across multiple districts
- Start with smaller land parcels before committing to larger investments

This plan aligns with Antonio's security-focused approach while creating a foundation for sustainable growth and influence in La Serenissima.
