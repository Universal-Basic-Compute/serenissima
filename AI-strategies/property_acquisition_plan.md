- Problems: Homeless, Workless (despite employment at Small Warehouse)
- Dependencies: Paying rent to multiple landlords, employed by VenicePhotographer

## Strategic Objectives
1. **Acquire Personal Residence**
   - Target: Medium-quality home in a respectable district
   - Budget: Up to 300,000 ducats (26.5% of current wealth)
   - Timeline: Immediate acquisition when suitable property identified

2. **Establish Commercial Property**
   - Target: Small or medium warehouse near water access
   - Budget: Up to 400,000 ducats (35.4% of current wealth)
   - Timeline: Within 1-2 weeks of residence acquisition

3. **Land Investment**
   - Target: 1-2 parcels with development potential
   - Budget: Up to 200,000 ducats (17.7% of current wealth)
   - Timeline: Opportunistic acquisition when favorable terms available

## Implementation Plan
1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Survey available residential properties
   - Investigate commercial buildings for sale, prioritizing warehouses
   - Review land sale contracts for investment opportunities

2. **Secondary Actions**
   - Analyze resource market to identify profitable trade goods
   - Evaluate potential business models for acquired commercial property
   - Consider strategic relationships with suppliers and potential clients

3. **Risk Management**
   - Maintain minimum reserve of 200,000 ducats (17.7% of current wealth)
   - Prioritize properties with minimal maintenance requirements initially
   - Avoid overextension by limiting initial acquisitions to 2-3 properties

## Expected Outcomes
- Resolution of "homeless" and "workless" problems
- Establishment of independent economic base
- Reduced vulnerability to rent/wage fluctuations
- Foundation for future commercial expansion
- Enhanced status among Cittadini class
