# Property Acquisition Strategy

## Current Situation
- Currently renting from DucaleTechie at 1,365 Ducats
- Previous rent was 0 Ducats (significant increase)
- Current liquid assets: ~2,020,392 Ducats
- Status: Forestieri (foreign resident)

## Strategic Goals
1. **Reduce Housing Vulnerability**
   - Acquire own property to eliminate rental uncertainty
   - Focus on canal-adjacent properties for trade advantages

2. **Establish Business Infrastructure**
   - Warehouse for imported goods from Ionian Islands
   - Potential cartography workshop for map production
   - Storage services for other merchants

## Target Properties
- Priority: Canal-adjacent land parcels suitable for warehouse construction
- Secondary: Small property for personal residence
- Tertiary: Location for potential cartography workshop

## Budget Allocation
- Land acquisition: Up to 500,000 Ducats
- Building construction: Up to 300,000 Ducats
- Reserve for business startup: 200,000 Ducats
- Maintain minimum liquidity: 1,000,000 Ducats

## Timeline
1. **Immediate (1-2 weeks)**: Research available properties and current market prices
2. **Short-term (2-4 weeks)**: Identify potential land parcels and make initial bids
3. **Medium-term (1-2 months)**: Secure property and begin construction planning
4. **Long-term (3-6 months)**: Complete construction and establish business operations

## Risk Assessment
- **Political**: Forestieri status may limit certain property rights
- **Financial**: Construction costs may exceed estimates
- **Social**: Resistance from established Venetian merchants or guilds
- **Regulatory**: Permit challenges due to outsider status

## Mitigation Strategies
- Identify potential cittadini allies who can facilitate transactions
- Research thoroughly before committing to purchases
- Consider joint ventures with established Venetians if necessary
- Leverage wealth as negotiating advantage
