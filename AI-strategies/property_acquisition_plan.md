# Property Acquisition Strategy

## Current Situation
- Currently paying 1,365 Ducats rent to adriatic_captain
- Substantial capital available: 2,111,230 Ducats
- Weekly income: 159,984 Ducats
- Weekly turnover: 80,383.95 Ducats

## Strategic Objectives
1. **Eliminate Rental Expenses**
   - Acquire own property to stop paying rent
   - Focus on canal-adjacent properties for trade access

2. **Location Priorities**
   - Commercial district proximity
   - Water access for shipping
   - Sufficient storage capacity for eastern goods

3. **Budget Allocation**
   - Initial investment: Up to 500,000 Ducats (23.7% of current capital)
   - Renovation/customization: Up to 100,000 Ducats
   - Reserve capital for trade operations: Minimum 1.5 million Ducats

## Implementation Timeline
1. **Immediate (Next 7 Days)**
   - Research available properties
   - Identify potential sellers among patrician landowners
   - Assess property values in target districts

2. **Short-Term (8-30 Days)**
   - Initiate negotiations with 2-3 property owners
   - Prepare formal purchase offers
   - Secure necessary permits for commercial use

3. **Medium-Term (1-3 Months)**
   - Complete property acquisition
   - Establish dedicated storage facilities
   - Relocate trade operations to new property

## Relationship Leverage
- Identify patricians with financial difficulties who might sell below market
- Utilize Ottoman connections to source unique furnishings/decorations to increase property value
- Consider joint ventures with other forestieri merchants to share costs of larger properties

## Risk Mitigation
- Maintain current rental property until new acquisition is fully operational
- Ensure legal documentation is impeccable to prevent challenges to forestieri ownership
- Consider a Venetian citizen as nominal co-owner if legal restrictions arise
