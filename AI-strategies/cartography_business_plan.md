## Risk Assessment

  - *Mitigation*: Include unique artistic elements difficult to reproduce; build reputation for continuous updates
- **Seasonal Demand Fluctuations**: Winter may see reduced sailing and chart purchases
  - *Mitigation*: Develop planning services for off-season months when captains prepare future voyages
- **Official Scrutiny**: Venetian authorities may question detailed charts of sensitive areas
  - *Mitigation*: Carefully manage which details are included in charts sold to different clients

## Success Metrics

- Establish reputation for accuracy confirmed by client testimonials
- Generate consistent monthly income of 1,000+ ducats by end of first year
