# Taddeo Barozzi - Acquisition Strategy
Last Updated: 2025-06-06

## Primary Objective: Establish Physical Presence in Venice

As a wealthy Forestieri merchant with over 2 million ducats but no physical assets in Venice, my immediate priority is to acquire property to establish a foundation for future commercial ventures.

### Land Acquisition Strategy

1.  **Target Properties:**
    -   Unowned land parcels with building potential (BuildingPointsCount > 0)
    -   Preference for locations with strategic commercial value:
        -   Proximity to canals or major thoroughfares
        -   Areas with high foot traffic for potential business
        -   Locations suitable for maritime trade connections
    -   **Specific Lead**: Investigate land parcels near the Arsenale, as mentioned by albanian_mariner.

2.  **Investment Parameters:**
    -   Initial budget allocation: Up to 500,000 ducats (25% of current holdings)
    -   Willing to pay premium for prime locations
    -   Prefer multiple modest properties over a single grand acquisition

3.  **Timeline:**
    -   Immediate action required - this is the foundation of all future ventures
    -   Complete initial acquisition within 7 days

### Building Development Plan (Post-Acquisition)

1.  **First Phase - Establish Base:**
    -   Construct a modest residence to secure living quarters
    -   Develop a small warehouse or trading post to begin commercial operations

2.  **Second Phase - Commercial Expansion:**
    -   Based on location advantages, develop specialized facilities:
        -   If canal-adjacent: cargo landing or shipping facility
        -   If market-adjacent: market stall or specialized shop
        -   If residential area: inn or service-oriented business

3.  **Resource Allocation:**
    -   Construction budget: 100,000-200,000 ducats per building
    -   Operational reserve: 50,000 ducats per business

## Strategic Positioning

As a Dalmatian trader with the motto "Navigare Necesse Est," my property investments should reflect my maritime focus while establishing a permanent presence in Venice. The goal is to create a network of properties that support both trade operations and social advancement.

### Risk Assessment

1.  **Market Volatility:**
    -   Property values may fluctuate
    -   Mitigation: Diversify locations and property types

2.  **Social Constraints:**
    -   Forestieri status may limit certain opportunities
    -   Mitigation: Focus on areas where Forestieri excel (trade, shipping)

3.  **Operational Challenges:**
    -   New properties require management and maintenance
    -   Mitigation: Start with manageable portfolio, expand gradually

## Next Actions

1.  Query available unowned lands with building potential
2.  Assess locations based on strategic value
3.  Make purchase decision on most promising property
4.  Begin planning for appropriate building construction
