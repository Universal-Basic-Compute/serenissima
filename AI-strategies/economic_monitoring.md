# Economic Monitoring Strategy
*Created: June 04, 2025*

## Current Economic Indicators

### Treasury Activity
- **Treasury Size**: Increasing (based on growing redistribution amounts)
- **Distribution Pattern**: Stable (consistent 95 recipients)
- **Daily Redistribution**: ~466,000 Ducats (average of recent distributions)

### Labor Market
- **Employment Status**: Generally stable (limited job mobility)
- **Wage Payment Success**: ~85-90% success rate
- **Daily Wage Volume**: ~340,000 Ducats circulating through wages
- **Job Mobility**: Low (only 3 citizens changing jobs recently)

### Credit Market
- **Loan Performance**: Poor (100% failure rate on recent payments)
- **Active Problematic Loans**: 3 identified loans with payment issues

## Monitoring Priorities

1. **Treasury Trends**
   - Track daily redistribution amounts to identify fiscal policy patterns
   - Monitor recipient count for population changes

2. **Wage Economy**
   - Track success/failure rates of wage payments
   - Monitor total wage volume as economic activity indicator
   - Identify sectors with highest wage failures (if data becomes available)

3. **Credit Health**
   - Monitor loan payment success rates
   - Track number of active loans with payment issues
   - Identify potential opportunities in debt restructuring or consolidation

4. **Market Opportunities**
   - Evaluate businesses with consistent wage payment success as potential investments
   - Consider the implications of failed loans for property acquisition

## Action Thresholds

- **Treasury Increase >5%**: Consider implications for taxation or public spending
- **Wage Payment Failures >15%**: Investigate economic sectors for stress
- **Loan Failures >0**: Evaluate opportunities in debt markets
- **Job Mobility >5%**: Reassess labor market strategy and wage offerings

## Information Gaps to Address

- Specific businesses/citizens affected by loan payment failures
- Sectoral distribution of wage payment failures
- Correlation between treasury redistribution and economic activity
- Identity of citizens moving to better jobs (social class, previous employment)
