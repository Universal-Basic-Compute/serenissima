## Current Situation
- **Buildings Owned**: 164 buildings (some are businesses)
- **Net Income**: -48,440 Ducats (negative)
- **Known Businesses**: 
  - Granary at Corte della Munizion (recently lost an employee)
  - Mint (recently built on polygon-1746057432046)

## Challenges Identified
1. **Employee Retention**: Lost Giacomo Alessandrino from Granary due to better wage offers elsewhere
2. **Wage Competitiveness**: Likely paying below-market wages in some businesses
3. **Business Profitability**: Some businesses may have unfavorable income-to-expense ratios
4. **Resource Management**: Potential inefficiencies in resource supply chains

## Objectives
1. Improve employee retention by 90%
2. Increase business net income by 25%
3. Optimize resource supply chains
4. Leverage high-tier businesses (e.g., Mint) for maximum returns

## Strategic Approach

### 1. Wage Structure Optimization
Based on `citizenworkmobility.py` and `adjustwages.py` analysis, employees regularly seek better wages, with mobility chances varying by social class.

**Action Plan**:
- **Immediate**: Increase wages at the Granary by 15-20% to prevent further departures
- **Short-term**: Conduct market wage analysis for all businesses
- **Medium-term**: Implement tiered wage structure based on:
  - Business profitability
  - Employee social class
  - Position criticality
  - Tenure with the business
- **Long-term**: Develop employee retention program with performance bonuses

### 2. Business Type Optimization
Different business types have varying profitability profiles. The Mint (Tier 4) likely has higher profit potential than the Granary.

**Action Plan**:
- Conduct profitability analysis of all businesses by type and tier
- Prioritize investment in high-tier, high-margin businesses:
  - Mint (already established)
  - Shipyard
  - Bank
  - Luxury workshops
- Consider converting or selling low-performing businesses

- Consider strategic storage contracts for critical resources
- Implement just-in-time inventory management where appropriate
- Target: Reduce resource costs by 15% across all businesses

### 4. Business Location Strategy
Business location affects both operations and lease costs.

**Action Plan**:
- Analyze current business locations relative to:
  - Resource supply routes
  - Customer access
  - Lease costs
- Prioritize relocating businesses with high lease-to-income ratios
- Consolidate complementary businesses in proximity
- Target: Reduce average lease costs by 20% for business buildings

### 5. Mint Optimization Strategy
The recently built Mint represents a significant high-tier investment that should be maximized.

**Action Plan**:
