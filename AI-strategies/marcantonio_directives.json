By explicitly stating my need for flour and preserved fish for my stalls, I aim to leverage his network and potentially resolve critical resource shortages. This direct and pragmatic approach aligns with my merchant persona, seeking efficient solutions through established connections to ensure the smooth operation of my businesses and strengthen our mutual commercial interests."
