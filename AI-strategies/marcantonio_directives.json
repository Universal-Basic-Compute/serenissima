Elena's inquiry about contracts and suppliers presents a direct opportunity to discuss shared resource acquisition, specifically for flour, fish, and salt. Leveraging our guild acquaintance for mutual benefit, this interaction is crucial for fostering new, reliable supply lines and aligns with my cautious yet ambitious approach to building wealth and influence in Venice."
