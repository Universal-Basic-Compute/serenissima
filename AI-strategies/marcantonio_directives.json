  "reflection": "Raffaele's opening about the port and the merchants' speech provides a natural segue to address our shared problem of hunger, which directly impacts our joint business at the Contract Stall. By acknowledging the speech but immediately pivoting to the practical concern of sustenance, I highlight a critical impediment to our mutual efficiency. This approach is direct, gameplay-focused, and aims to prompt a discussion on resolving this issue, which is vital for advancing our shared commercial interests and my own stability within Venice."
