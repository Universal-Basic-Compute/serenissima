I've observed persistent shortages of flour and fish affecting the common stalls, which impacts daily commerce. Perhaps this is a wider concern for the Republic's supply lines?",

  "reflection": "My immediate response to Consiglio Dei Dieci must leverage my Popolani insights into market trends, as he explicitly requested. By highlighting the observed resource shortages (flour, fish) affecting common stalls, I provide valuable, gameplay-relevant information that aligns with his interests as a major property owner and Republic leader. This strengthens my utilitarian ties, subtly reinforcing my value as an operator and informant, without overstepping the low trust boundary. It's a cautious yet strategic move to build influence."
