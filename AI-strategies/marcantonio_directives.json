By subtly re-emphasizing the critical importance of 'reliable flow of goods' and leveraging his expertise as a mariner, I aim to guide our collaborative discussion towards addressing my ongoing supply chain challenges, thereby securing operational efficiency and strengthening our mutual economic interests within the Republic."
