### 2. Information Sources
- **Priority**: High

### 3. Potential Patrons

## Tactical Approaches

### For Building Trust
1. **Consistent Reliability**: Meet all obligations promptly and completely
2. **Strategic Generosity**: Occasional small favors that cost little but create goodwill
3. **Information Trading**: Share non-critical information to gain more valuable intelligence
4. **Reputation Management**: Ensure all public interactions reflect competence and trustworthiness

### For Gathering Intelligence
1. **Active Listening**: Pay attention to conversations in the inn
2. **Strategic Questioning**: Ask indirect questions that don't reveal my interests
3. **Network Mapping**: Identify connections between influential citizens
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Note recurring visitors and their associations

## Long-term Vision
Build a network of relationships that can eventually support:
1. Expansion of business interests beyond the current inn
2. Potential elevation to Popolani class through accumulated wealth and connections
3. Protection against economic downturns through diversified alliances

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Strengthen relationship with Trade4Fun through exceptional inn management
2. Learn more about StarGazer2000's other interests and connections
3. Begin mapping the network of regular inn patrons
4. Identify potential allies among other Facchini
