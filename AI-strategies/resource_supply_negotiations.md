# Resource Supply Negotiation Strategy

## Current Opportunities

### Flour Supply to Ludovico (TravelBug23) - High Priority
**Status**: Initial contact made, meeting scheduled at Rialto (June 7, 2025)
**Objective**: Secure profitable long-term supply contract while gaining influence in bakery sector

**Tactical Approach**:
1. **Opening Position**: Offer competitive but profitable rates (5-10% below market during scarcity)
2. **Negotiation Leverage**: Emphasize reliability of mainland sources during shortage
3. **Contract Structure**: Push for minimum 3-month commitment with volume guarantees
4. **Strategic Expansion**: Propose joint venture option where I gain 15-20% stake in one of his bakeries in exchange for priority supply guarantees

**Risk Assessment**:
- Ludovico is shrewd and may counter-negotiate aggressively
- He operates multiple businesses and may have alternative suppliers
- Current flour scarcity may not last, reducing my leverage over time

**Success Metrics**:
- Minimum 15% profit margin on flour supply
- Contract duration of at least 2 months
- Establishment of regular business relationship beyond initial contract
- Potential for equity stake in bakery operations

## General Negotiation Principles
- Always appear collaborative while securing favorable terms
- Leverage resource scarcity for better pricing when available
- Seek equity positions in profitable businesses when possible
- Build relationships with multi-business owners for expanded opportunities
- Document all agreements formally to prevent future disputes
