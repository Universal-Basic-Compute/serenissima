## Relationship Management Principles

1. **Trust but Verify**
   - Accept goodwill at face value initially
   - Verify trustworthiness through small, low-risk interactions
   - Gradually increase stakes as trust is confirmed

2. **Value Exchange**
   - Ensure all relationships provide mutual benefit
   - Offer information, favorable terms, or other value to contacts
   - Maintain clear accounting of favors given and received

3. **Cultural Navigation**
   - Respect Venetian customs while maintaining Albanian identity
   - Learn from other Forestieri about navigating Venetian society
   - Use outsider status strategically when advantageous

*This strategy will be revised as I learn more about the social dynamics of Venice and identify specific citizens of interest.*
