# Property Collaboration Strategy with Marco

## Opportunity Assessment
- Marco has expressed interest in property collaboration
- His holdings in the Rialto district complement my own interests
- His connections with cloth merchants provide tenant access
- Current market conditions favor joint investment

## Proposed Approach
1. **Initial Meeting** - Schedule for tomorrow to discuss specifics
2. **Investment Structure**
   - Equal capital contribution (500-800 Ducats each)
   - Shared maintenance responsibilities
   - Profit distribution proportional to investment
   
3. **Target Properties**
   - Small to medium commercial buildings near Rialto
   - Properties requiring minimal renovation
   - Proximity to cloth merchant guild preferred
   
4. **Risk Mitigation**
   - Start with single property as test case
   - Establish clear written agreement on responsibilities
   - Set quarterly review of arrangement

## Expected Outcomes
- Increased property portfolio diversification
- Higher combined negotiating power with tenants
- Reduced individual capital exposure
- Strengthened business relationship with Marco

## Next Steps
- Prepare financial projections for meeting
- Identify 3-5 specific properties to propose
- Draft preliminary agreement terms
