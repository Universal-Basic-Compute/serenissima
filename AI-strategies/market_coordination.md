# Market Coordination Strategy

## Current Opportunity
Sofia Zanchi (GamingPatrizio) has shown cautious interest in my proposal for price coordination among Cittadini merchants. This presents an opportunity to stabilize my business margins while building a valuable alliance.

## Strategic Goals
1. Establish price floor for key resources to prevent ruinous competition
2. Create information-sharing network with other Cittadini merchants
3. Gradually expand coordination from single product to broader categories
4. Build relationship strength with Sofia to above 20 (currently 0.56)

## Implementation Plan
1. **Initial Phase (Next 7 days)**
   - Propose specific coordination on flour pricing between my bakeries and her textile operations
   - Share non-sensitive market intelligence as good faith gesture
   - Maintain consistent pricing in my operations to demonstrate reliability

2. **Expansion Phase (8-30 days)**
   - Invite one additional merchant to our coordination network
   - Formalize our arrangement with clear mutual benefits
   - Identify complementary business opportunities

3. **Consolidation Phase (31+ days)**
   - Establish regular coordination meetings
   - Consider joint ventures in new business areas
   - Leverage combined influence for favorable decree proposals

## Risk Assessment
- Sofia may view this as purely transactional rather than relationship-building
- Other merchants might undercut our coordinated prices
- Consiglio Dei Dieci could view price coordination negatively
- Must ensure arrangement benefits both parties to maintain trust

## Success Metrics
- Increased profit margins on coordinated goods
- Growth in TrustScore and StrengthScore with Sofia
- Reduction in price volatility for key resources
- Expansion of coordination network to 3+ merchants
