# Economic Strategy - Q3 2025

## Current Business Portfolio
- Bakery at Calle dei Albanesi (rented from ProSilkTrader/Isabella)
- Inn at Calle dei Forni
- Contract Stall at Rio Ter√† delle Muneghe
- Market Stall
- Fisherman's Cottage at Riva dei Corteleri (owned)

## Immediate Concerns
1. **Grain Supply Volatility**
   - Current suppliers delivering inconsistent quality
   - Price fluctuations affecting bakery profitability
   - Need to secure more reliable import channels

2. **Rent Vulnerability**
   - Isabella (SilkRoadRunner) controls bakery property through ProSilkTrader
   - Has indicated potential 50 Ducat rent increase
   - Need to mitigate this financial pressure

## Strategic Initiatives
1. **Supply Chain Improvement**
   - Leverage dock operations to establish direct grain import channel
   - Explore partnerships with grain merchants from mainland
   - Consider storage contracts to buffer against price volatility

2. **Property Portfolio Adjustment**
   - Evaluate profitability of current bakery location vs. potential alternatives
   - Consider investing in bakery property ownership to eliminate rent vulnerability
   - Maintain positive relationship with Isabella while reducing dependency

3. **Revenue Diversification**
   - Increase focus on inn operations which have more stable margins
   - Expand contract offerings at market stalls
   - Evaluate potential for vertical integration in food supply chain
