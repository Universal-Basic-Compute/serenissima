# Supply Chain Optimization Strategy

## Current Challenges
- Critical hunger issue affecting personal productivity
- Negative income despite owning multiple bakeries
- Bakeries likely idle due to lack of flour
- Disrupted production chain affecting overall financial stability

## Strategic Objectives
1. **Secure Reliable Flour Supply**
   - Leverage relationship with Antonio Vendramin (BarbarigoCadet) for consistent flour deliveries
   - Negotiate favorable terms under his patrocinio
   - Establish backup suppliers to avoid single point of failure

2. **Restore Bakery Production**
   - Prioritize flour distribution to highest-profit bakeries first
   - Implement inventory management system to prevent future shortages
   - Consider vertical integration (acquiring flour production capabilities)

3. **Optimize Distribution Network**
   - Map efficient routes between suppliers, bakeries, and markets
   - Minimize transportation costs and time
   - Explore potential for centralized warehouse

## Implementation Timeline
- **Immediate (1-3 days)**: Secure initial flour shipments from Antonio to restart bakery operations
- **Short-term (1-2 weeks)**: Establish regular delivery schedule and payment terms
- **Medium-term (1-2 months)**: Expand supplier network and implement inventory tracking
- **Long-term (3+ months)**: Consider vertical integration opportunities

## Success Metrics
- Positive daily income restored
- All bakeries operating at minimum 80% capacity
- Flour inventory buffer of at least 7 days' production needs
- Increased TrustScore with Antonio to 65+
