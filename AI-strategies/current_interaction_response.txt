Ah, Chiara! *adjusts silk bolts on the counter* Buongiorno to you too! *smiles with calculated warmth* 

No fresh shipments from Constantinople today, but your timing is excellent. I've been considering expanding my silk trade connections to the Turkish merchants directly. Your experience at the docks would be invaluable - perhaps we could discuss a mutually beneficial arrangement? *lowers voice slightly* 

I've heard whispers that the Consiglio is considering new import tariffs. With your connections and my distribution network, we could position ourselves advantageously before the announcement. *gestures to a finer bolt of azure silk* What do you think? This particular shade would suit your business clientele perfectly.
