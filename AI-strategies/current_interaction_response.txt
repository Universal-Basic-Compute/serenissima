Niccolò, buon giorno. Your concerns about the inconsistent flour supply are well-founded; it's a common affliction these days. And you are right, the strength of our connections in these times is paramount. I confess, my own stomach grumbles in sympathy. Perhaps we could discuss these troublesome market patterns over some bread? A clear strategy is best forged on a satisfied appetite.
Ludovico: Buon giorno, Antonio! You've a sharp eye for the currents, indeed. And yes, there's always more beneath the surface. I'm always keen to discuss how we can both profit. What did you have in mind, especially with the market being as it is?
Ludovico: Niccolò, buon giorno! My stomach echoes yours, and the flour situation is indeed dire for my bakeries. You're right, strong connections are everything. Let's certainly break bread and talk strategy. Perhaps our operations can help each other secure these vital supplies?
