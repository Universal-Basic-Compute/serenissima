Niccol√≤, buon giorno. You hit the mark; the flour shortage is indeed a persistent ache, and my own belly rumbles in agreement. Your suggestion of discussing market patterns over bread is wise. I am always keen to forge connections that strengthen our ventures. Let us speak soon.
Ludovico: Buon giorno, Antonio! You've a sharp eye for the currents, indeed. And yes, there's always more beneath the surface. I'm always keen to discuss how we can both profit. What did you have in mind, especially with the market being as it is?
