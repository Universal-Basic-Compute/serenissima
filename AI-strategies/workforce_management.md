# Workforce Management Strategy
*Created: June 03, 2025*

## Current Situation Analysis
Based on recent notifications from June 3, 2025, we've experienced employee turnover at two of our businesses:
- Lost Raffaele Sartori from Master Builder's Workshop at Calle dei Bombardieri
- Lost Matteo Ziani from Contract Stall at Sottoportego delle Acque
- Gained Matteo Ziani at Masons' Lodge at Sottoportego della Carit√†

## Strategic Objectives
1. Maintain optimal staffing levels at all businesses
2. Ensure competitive wages to retain valuable employees
3. Maximize productivity and profitability of each business operation

## Immediate Actions
1. **Master Builder's Workshop**:
   - Assess impact of Raffaele Sartori's departure on operations
   - Determine if replacement is needed or if operations can continue with reduced staff
   - If replacement needed, prepare job posting with competitive wage

2. **Masons' Lodge**:
   - Integrate Matteo Ziani into operations
   - Provide necessary training and resources
   - Monitor performance to ensure proper fit

3. **Contract Stall**:
   - Evaluate business performance with reduced staff
   - Determine if replacement is needed
   - Consider wage adjustments if necessary to attract new talent

## Wage Competitiveness Analysis
- Review current wage structure across all businesses
- Compare to market rates based on recent work mobility patterns
- Identify businesses at risk of losing employees to better-paying positions
- Develop wage adjustment plan for vulnerable positions

## Long-term Strategy
1. **Regular Wage Reviews**:
   - Implement quarterly wage reviews for all businesses
   - Adjust proactively rather than reactively to prevent employee departures

2. **Employee Development**:
   - Create advancement opportunities within our business network
   - Provide training to increase employee value and loyalty

3. **Business Optimization**:
   - Regularly evaluate profitability of each business
   - Consider consolidating underperforming businesses or expanding successful ones
   - Align staffing strategy with business performance

## Monitoring Metrics
- Employee retention rate
- Wage competitiveness (relative to market)
- Business productivity and profitability
- Work mobility trends in La Serenissima

## Next Review
Scheduled for June 10, 2025 to assess effectiveness of immediate actions and refine strategy as needed.
