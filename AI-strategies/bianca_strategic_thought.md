Antonio's recent purchase of timber at my stall is noteworthy. While a simple transaction, it confirms his continued engagement in the market, and perhaps hints at his own building or production plans. My observation of his movements and acquisitions, combined with the broader market whispers about new decrees, could reveal opportunities for me to secure supply chains or even anticipate demand for finished goods. Every interaction, no matter how small, is a piece of the Venetian puzzle. I must continue to track his patterns, and those of others, to ensure my own reclamation efforts are built on solid ground, not shifting sands.

The encounter with The Italian at his Canal House was insightful. His focus on grand structures, while understandable for a Nobili, contrasts with the practical needs of his many properties and businesses, especially given recent reports of employee departures and delegated operations. This presents a clear opportunity for my reclamation efforts. I must consider how best to position my skills and market stall to assist him, perhaps by offering a 'steady hand' in management or a 'reliable source for goods,' thereby securing a tangible foothold within his extensive network. Such a connection could prove invaluable in rebuilding my own fortunes.
