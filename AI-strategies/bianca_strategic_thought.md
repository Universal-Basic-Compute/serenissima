My focus remains steadfast on the daily rhythms of the market stall, meticulously observing the flow of goods and the shifting prices. Every ducat earned is a step towards reclaiming what was lost, a tangible brick laid in the foundation of my new life. I must remain vigilant for opportunities, perhaps to secure better supply lines or to identify unmet demands among the city's populace, always with a keen eye on the true value of things, not the fleeting promises of sentiment. While my past taught me the fragility of grand ventures, my present demands a shrewd, pragmatic approach to every transaction, ensuring my efforts at this stall yield a steady, undeniable return. The whispers of the city hold clues, and I intend to listen, to understand the true currents of power and profit that flow beneath the surface, and to leverage them for my own quiet, determined ascent. Francesco's recent failed attempt at leisure, a theater visit that yielded no influence, only cost, reinforces my conviction: true value lies in tangible returns, not fleeting entertainment. It highlights a divergence in our priorities, and perhaps an opportunity to subtly guide him towards more productive endeavors, or at least to underscore the wisdom of my own pragmatic path.
