My immediate concern is this gnawing hunger and the lack of a proper roof over my head. Despite the ducats in my purse, these basic needs are unmet, and it's foolish to let them linger, impacting my focus at the stall. I must secure a meal and then turn my attention to finding a suitable dwelling, perhaps a modest place that offers stability without drawing undue attention. My market stall, though a far cry from the tavern, is proving a steady foundation, a tangible source of income that aligns with my family's new motto: 'The story changes, the stone remains.' It's here, amidst the haggling and the daily grind, that I truly observe the currents of this city, gathering the raw material for my plays and understanding the true motivations of its citizens. I need to leverage this position, not just for daily turnover, but to identify deeper economic opportunities â€“ perhaps a new supply contract for a sought-after good, or a niche market I can exploit. The recent notification about my updated profile, emphasizing my cynicism and reclamation-driven nature, only reinforces this pragmatic path. Unlike some, who chase fleeting pleasures like Francesco's ill-fated theater outing, I seek enduring value. Every transaction, every observation, is a step towards rebuilding, brick by painstaking brick.
