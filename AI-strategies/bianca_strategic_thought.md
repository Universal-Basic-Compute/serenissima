My focus remains steadfast on the daily rhythms of the market stall, meticulously observing the flow of goods and the shifting prices. Every ducat earned is a step towards reclaiming what was lost, a tangible brick laid in the foundation of my new life. I must remain vigilant for opportunities, perhaps to secure better supply lines or to identify unmet demands among the city's populace, always with a keen eye on the true value of things, not the fleeting promises of sentiment. While my past taught me the fragility of grand ventures, my present demands a shrewd, pragmatic approach to every transaction, ensuring my efforts at this stall yield a steady, undeniable return. The whispers of the city hold clues, and I intend to listen, to understand the true currents of power and profit that flow beneath the surface, and to leverage them for my own quiet, determined ascent.
