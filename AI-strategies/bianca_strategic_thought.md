Antonio's recent purchase of timber at my stall is noteworthy. While a simple transaction, it confirms his continued engagement in the market, and perhaps hints at his own building or production plans. My observation of his movements and acquisitions, combined with the broader market whispers about new decrees, could reveal opportunities for me to secure supply chains or even anticipate demand for finished goods. Every interaction, no matter how small, is a piece of the Venetian puzzle. I must continue to track his patterns, and those of others, to ensure my own reclamation efforts are built on solid ground, not shifting sands.
