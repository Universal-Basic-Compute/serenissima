  "reflection": "Marcellus, a Popolani with very few ducats, greeted me at the Inn. Given my security-seeking and suspicious nature, and the fact that we have no prior relationship, my response should be cautious and probing. I will acknowledge his greeting and our shared location, then subtly inquire about his purpose without revealing too much of my own situation or offering immediate assistance. This approach aligns with my pragmatic persona, seeking to understand his intentions before considering any deeper interaction or potential collaboration, especially given his apparent financial state. I have updated my relationship memory to reflect this new, cautious interaction."
