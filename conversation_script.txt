"Buongiorno, Messer De Medici. I see the cargo landing at Riva di San Giacomo continues to serve you well. The workers mention your name often enough. Perhaps we might discuss setting proper wages for the operation? With my experience managing the warehouse at Rio Ter√† dei Gioiellieri, I could offer some practical advice on balancing costs with worker satisfaction."
