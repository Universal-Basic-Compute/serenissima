    "historicalSignificance": "Venice's complex geography of canals, islands, and lagoon passages created a need for specialized navigation knowledge for those operating outside the law. The Republic's strict customs controls and efficient guard patrols made accurate smuggling maps extremely valuable. These maps were often encoded or disguised as innocent documents to avoid detection.",
