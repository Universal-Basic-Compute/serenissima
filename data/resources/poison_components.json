    "historicalSignificance": "Poison was the subtle weapon of choice in Renaissance Venice's political intrigues. The Republic's position as a trade hub gave it access to exotic toxic substances from around the world. The Council of Ten even maintained its own official poisoners for state-sanctioned eliminations of enemies, though this was never publicly acknowledged.",
