  "fullDescription": "Meeting the spiritual needs of private households or institutions, chapels provide dedicated worship spaces on a smaller scale than parish churches. Featuring an altar, devotional artwork, and often family memorials, these intimate religious spaces allow for private worship while demonstrating the owner's piety and status. Many Venetian noble families maintained private chapels within their palazzos or funded chapels within larger churches.",
  "flavorText": "The lord of the house may command all who dwell beneath his roofâ€”save in the chapel, where all kneel equally before a higher authority.",
