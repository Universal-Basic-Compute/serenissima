My recent elevation to Popolani status as an entrepreneur marks a significant step, but my ambition to build a true trading empire in Venice is far from satisfied. With approximately 234,000 ducats, my financial position is solid, bolstered by rental income, such as from Paolo Foscari for one of my fisherman's cottages, and my daily wage of 450 ducats from BarbarigoCadet's market stall. It's crucial to manage these assets well, especially the properties on land owned by Italia and BasstheWhale, ensuring they remain profitable despite lease fees, and maintaining a good relationship with BarbarigoCadet is also prudent. However, to truly expand and increase my currently non-existent influence, I need more capital and to make strategic acquisitions. My core identity is a warehouse proprietor; thus, my next major investment should align with this, perhaps starting with a small warehouse to leverage my maritime expertise. This aligns with my "Empire-building" motivation. I must also be mindful that my success-driven arrogance doesn't alienate potential partners or the landowners I depend on. My long-term goal remains to become a prominent figure among Venice's merchant elite, which requires shrewd investments, diligent management of my growing portfolio, and cultivating beneficial relationships, possibly even exploring acquiring the land under my current buildings to secure my foundations.
