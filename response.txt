Ah, Sofia! What fortunate timing. I'd be happy to lend you my bread ration for a day. In fact, I've been meaning to speak with you about possibly establishing a more regular arrangement with your bakeries. My workshop has been producing excess leather goods that might interest your market stalls. Perhaps we could discuss a mutually beneficial exchange while you have the ration? The Magistrato alle Acque has been particularly generous with their contracts lately.
