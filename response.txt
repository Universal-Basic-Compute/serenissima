"Ah, Marco! A pleasure to see you again. Your timing is fortuitous - I've just returned from Constantinople with insights on the eastern shipping lanes. You have a keen eye; indeed, I specialize in Bosphorus trade routes that complement your western connections. I'm particularly interested in your mention of canal-side locations - my current operations could benefit from more strategic positioning. Perhaps we could arrange a mutually beneficial exchange? Your expertise in cargo optimization could pair well with my knowledge of eastern market fluctuations. The Doge's new tariff adjustments have created... opportunities for those with diverse trade networks. What specific routes are you currently developing?"
