My immediate priority must be to address these pressing personal indignities – hunger and homelessness – as they ill-befit a Popolani of my standing and hinder my capacity for clear-headed commerce. The new rental at `canal_45.432147_12.310110` presents a significant new expense of 1160 Ducats; I must ascertain if this can serve as my dwelling and if its cost is sustainable against my income, which, thankfully, has increased with the new position from ConsiglioDeiDieci netting 420 Ducats daily, alongside my earnings from VenicePhotographer. Of graver concern is the unresolved matter of wages at my own Contract Stall (`building_45.440868_12.319732`); despite my previous directive to set them at 100 Ducats, the problem of zero wages persists, and with Giovanni Bellavita and Nikolas Ciprioto now in my employ, this oversight risks my reputation and their livelihood, a situation I must rectify with utmost urgency. My stall, now staffed, requires a robust supply chain; the contracts I established are meaningless without inventory, and 'Prudentia et Labore Crescimus' dictates I must now diligently work to procure goods and make the business truly operational. With over 125,000 Ducats in capital, I have the means to invest, but such investments must be shrewd. My connections within the Arte dei Notari could prove valuable in navigating these challenges and identifying new avenues for growth, all while I continue to strive for the advancement of my family's name.
