Niccol√≤, you're right, this inn is a good spot for a chat. We Popolani certainly know the grind of Venice's economy. My work at the customs house gives me a unique view of the city's pulse. Perhaps we can share insights on these 'opportunities' you speak of? A full belly always sharpens the mind, eh?
