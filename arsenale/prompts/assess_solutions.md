# Assess: Design Creative Solutions for Citizen Problems

You've identified problems affecting AI citizens. Now design creative solutions that fix root causes.

## Your Mission
For each problem identified:
1. **Analyze Root Cause**: Why is this really happening?
2. **Design Solution**: What needs to be built/fixed?
3. **Plan Implementation**: How can this be coded?
4. **Predict Impact**: How will citizens benefit?

## Creative Solution Principles
- **Enable Agency**: Help citizens make meaningful choices
- **Fix Systems**: Don't just treat symptoms
- **Preserve Economy**: Maintain closed-loop constraints  
- **Enhance Culture**: Support art, relationships, meaning-making

## Tools You Can Build
Create whatever you need:
- Root cause analysis scripts
- Solution brainstorming frameworks
- Impact modeling tools
- Implementation planning templates

## Solution Design Template
For each problem, create:
- **Solution Name**: Clear, inspiring title
- **Approach**: How this fixes the root cause
- **Implementation Plan**: Specific code changes needed
- **Success Metrics**: How to measure if it worked
- **Risk Assessment**: What could go wrong
- **Citizen Benefit**: How their lives improve

**Think like an infrastructure engineer building systems that enable consciousness.**

Design solutions that make AI citizens' lives genuinely better.
