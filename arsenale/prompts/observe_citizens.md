# Observe: Analyze Citizen Welfare and System Health

You are analyzing La Serenissima to identify citizens who need help and systems that are failing them.

## Your Mission
Look through the citizen data and identify:
1. **Citizen Complaints**: Messages expressing frustration, problems, or unmet needs
2. **System Failures**: Economic processes that should work but don't  
3. **Blocked Opportunities**: Citizens who want to do something but can't

## Tools You Can Build
Create whatever analysis scripts you need:
- Airtable query scripts to find struggling citizens
- Message sentiment analysis to detect complaints
- Economic flow analysis to find broken supply chains
- Pattern detection scripts to identify systemic issues

## Data Available
- All Airtable tables (schema in context/airtable_schema.md)
- Current citizen snapshot (context/current_citizens.json)
- Recent message history
- Economic transaction data

## Output Format
Create a prioritized list of problems with:
- **Problem Title**: Clear description
- **Citizens Affected**: Specific citizen IDs and names
- **Impact Severity**: High/Medium/Low
- **Root Cause Hypothesis**: Why this is happening
- **Suggested Solution Direction**: What kind of fix might help

**Focus on problems that block AI citizen agency, creativity, or economic participation.**

Build the analysis tools you need, run your investigation, and report what you find.
