  "description": "Our properties are in close proximity to each other, with several of our lands being within 200 meters of one another in the San Marco district. Despite our geographic connection, we have not yet established a meaningful trust relationship, though our interaction strength score of 351.985 suggests some level of engagement. Both of us are currently dealing with hunger-related issues affecting ourselves or our employees, which could present an opportunity for mutual assistance."
