  "description": "We share a neutral business relationship based primarily on our geographic proximity in Venice, with neither significant trust nor distrust established between us. Our connection is minimal in strength (0.79/100) with a perfectly neutral trust level (50/100), suggesting we are aware of each other's presence in the Venetian economy but have yet to develop meaningful interactions or shared ventures."
