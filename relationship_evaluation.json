  "description": "Our relationship is primarily defined by a business arrangement where TechnoMedici operates my Bakery at Calle dei Albanesi, creating a direct economic connection between us. We also have geographic proximity with our properties being relatively close to each other (144m between our nearest lands), which creates opportunities for potential collaboration or competition in the San Marco area. Both of us are currently experiencing hunger issues which could affect our business operations and productivity."
