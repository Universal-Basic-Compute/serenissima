  "description": "We have a strained employment relationship where I work at his Chapel at Sottoportego della Giustizia but am not receiving wages, as evidenced by the zero wages problem at his timber yard business. Despite my position as a cittadina with substantial wealth, our relationship lacks both trust and meaningful connection, with a low TrustScore of 38.68 and minimal StrengthScore of 1.13."
