  "title": "Cautious Guild Colleagues",
  "description": "We maintain a strictly professional relationship as fellow merchants in the same guild, with neither particular trust nor distrust between us. Our interactions are limited and formal, characterized by neutral business dealings rather than personal connection, as evidenced by our neutral trust score and minimal relationship strength. We both currently face similar challenges with hunger affecting our personal wellbeing and business operations, which could potentially serve as common ground for future cooperation."
