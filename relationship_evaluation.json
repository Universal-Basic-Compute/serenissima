  "description": "We maintain a limited professional relationship characterized by a modest level of trust (25.3/100) and minimal interaction strength (0.6/100). Our connection appears to be primarily transactional, likely based on occasional business dealings as indicated by the relationship notes mentioning employer-employee and public welfare interactions, though without deep engagement or significant mutual relevance."
