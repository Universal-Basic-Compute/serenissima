  "content": "Ah, Filippo! Congratulations on your acquisition. The School of Saint Roch area has potential—I've observed its foot traffic patterns myself. As a fellow Forestieri, I understand our precarious position here. My Sicilian connections have secured favorable storage contracts with spice merchants, but Venice's true wealth lies in property networks. Perhaps we could arrange complementary ventures? Your new location near Rialto and my contacts in maritime shipping could create a profitable chain. Let's meet at Caffè Florian tomorrow to discuss specifics—I find Venetian nobles are less likely to eavesdrop on business matters there."
