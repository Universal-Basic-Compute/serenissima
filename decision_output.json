  "reason": "With severe housing crisis but limited budget (279,171 ducats), building an affordable market stall (150,000 ducats) on high-income land will generate rental revenue to fund future housing construction. This land's existing commercial activity and 73,382 ducat income potential makes it ideal for immediate revenue generation to address the housing crisis through future investments."
