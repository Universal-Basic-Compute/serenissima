A gnawing hunger reminds me of mortal needs, a simple matter to address with my ample ducats, yet it clears the mind for weightier concerns. The persistent, escalating bids for my land parcel, polygon-1746055488132, from both ConsiglioDeiDieci and Italia, present a significant decision. Over half a million ducats is a sum that could greatly accelerate my ambitions, perhaps allowing me to purchase the very grounds of my Murano workshop, thereby securing its legacy and reducing the burden of rent. Or, such capital could be funneled into acquiring even more exotic materials and fostering new, breathtaking innovations in cristallo glass, further burnishing my reputation which, alongside my standing as a Cittadini, is the bedrock of my family's ascent. I must also consider the lease I grant ConsiglioDeiDieci for their bridge upon that land; is the current income from it truly optimal, or would a sale better serve my long-term vision? My craft is my soul, and its continued excellence, supported by wise investments and the nurturing of my esteemed patrons, is paramount. These efforts, coupled with my duties to my guild and the Scuola Grande di San Rocco, all contribute to the ultimate aim: to see the Olak name firmly established amongst Venice's most respected families, ensuring a prosperous and influential future for my children.
