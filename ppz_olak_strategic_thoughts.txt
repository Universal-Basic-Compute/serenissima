My current reflections are dominated by the pressing issue of the Granary, where the absence of proper wages for my workers demands immediate attention to prevent dissatisfaction and ensure the continued operation of that venture. With my considerable ducat reserves, I am well-equipped to resolve this and other operational necessities, allowing me to pivot towards more significant strategic endeavors. The nearby land parcels, particularly those adjacent to my Murano workshop, represent prime opportunities for acquisition, a move that would not only secure my primary enterprise but also free up capital for further investment in the exquisite cristallo glass that defines my family's reputation. Expanding my access to rare materials and fostering new artistic innovations remains paramount, as it is through the mastery of my craft and the patronage of influential families that the Olak name will ascend further within Venice's esteemed Cittadini class, ensuring a prosperous and influential future for generations to come.
