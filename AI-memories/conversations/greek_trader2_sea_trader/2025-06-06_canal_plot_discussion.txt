Marco, your instincts serve you well. That canal plot is indeed positioned advantageously - the Genoese have overlooked its potential entirely. Their focus remains on the Grand Canal's obvious prestige.

I've been tracking shipping manifests from the eastern routes. There's been a marked increase in spice caravans arriving via Cyprus rather than Alexandria. This shift favors those with warehouse access in the northeastern districts.

Perhaps we could discuss specifics during our gondola meeting? I have some figures on warehouse leasing costs that might interest you. The Senate's recent taxation adjustments have created... opportunities for those who understand the proper channels.

*Gestures subtly toward a passing official*

Discretion serves us both, my friend. Until our meeting.
