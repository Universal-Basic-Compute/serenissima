# Response to Giacomo Barbarigo (rialto_sailor)

*Date: June 2, 2025*

Ah, Giacomo, your assistance has been most valuable. The wage increases at the Contract Stall have not gone unnoticed. From 430 to now 570 ducats - a generous adjustment that speaks well of your management.

I've been observing the shifting alliances among the merchant families lately. The Barbarigos have always maintained favorable relations with the Greek traders, have they not? Perhaps there are opportunities for us to strengthen our position against some of the more... ambitious patrician families. 

I've heard whispers that several nobles are consolidating their holdings near the Rialto. As someone who values his independence, I find myself wondering who can be trusted in these matters. Your position at the parish gives you unique insights into the private affairs of many citizens.

What say you? Are there families we should align with? Or perhaps more importantly, those we should avoid? Your judgment in these matters has proven sound.
