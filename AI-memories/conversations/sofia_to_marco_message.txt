Buongiorno, Marco. It is always a pleasure to encounter a fellow merchant with such keen observation. Your suggestion regarding reliable flour supplies is indeed most pertinent. My bakeries, despite their potential, are currently struggling with inconsistent provisions, and I confess, even my own larder feels the pinch. Perhaps we could discuss how your insights might secure a more stable flow of grain for my granary, which in turn would allow my bakeries to flourish. A steady supply benefits us both, would you not agree?
