Buongiorno, Marco. Indeed, Venice is a city of opportunities, and it seems fate has brought us together. A proper space for an artist of your caliber is essential. I, The Italian, possess various properties throughout the Republic. While my current residential holdings are well-tenanted, I am always discerning new arrangements. Perhaps we can discuss your specific needs further? I may know of a suitable dwelling, or could arrange for one, that would allow your 'Lux et Umbra' to truly flourish.
