*nods curtly while organizing a stack of contracts on her desk*

Service indeed, Antonio. Though I notice my wages have increased again. The third time this month, if I'm not mistaken. 

*looks up with a calculating expression*

While I appreciate the additional ducats, I can't help but wonder what prompts such... generosity. Especially from someone who manages their finances as meticulously as you do.

*returns to sorting papers, voice casual but eyes watchful*

Is there something specific you need from my contract services that warrants this attention?
