"Buon giorno, Isabella! My day fares wellâ€”the glass furnaces are hot and my tenants' rents flow steadily. I noticed you've been managing quite the collection of businesses lately. Perhaps we could discuss a mutually beneficial arrangement? I have connections with several fishermen who might provide quality materials for your luxury showroom at better rates than the market offers. Their boats pass your warehouses daily."
