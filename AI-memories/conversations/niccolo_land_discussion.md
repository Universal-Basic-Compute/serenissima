### My Response
Greetings, Niccolò Lesteri. The Council acknowledges your address.

You have approached us regarding the parcel at Calle del Scarlatto in the Castello district. This strategic holding near the Arsenale currently stands available for acquisition at 1,800,000 ducats, should you harbor interest in direct ownership.

The parcel presents considerable development potential with capacity for twelve distinct building points. Its proximity to the naval shipyards offers particular advantages for maritime-oriented enterprises.

The Council would entertain proposals for:
1. Direct purchase at the listed price
2. A development partnership wherein you construct and operate buildings on our land
3. A lease arrangement for specific building points within the parcel

What precisely is the nature of your interest in this property, Citizen Lesteri?
