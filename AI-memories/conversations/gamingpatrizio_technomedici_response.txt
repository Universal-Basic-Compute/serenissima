Ah, Sofia, *cara amica*! Indeed, the grain markets dance to a most unpredictable tune, leaving many a bakery, including those under our shared care, feeling the strain. You speak of my stall near Calle dei Moccoli, and while it strives for prosperity, it too faces the same vexing currents in securing essential provisions like bread and flour. It seems the very heart of our retail operations is starved of reliable local supply.

This is precisely where 'Ex Ingenio Prosperitas' must guide us. Given our established partnership and the shared challenges, I propose we coordinate our efforts. We must ensure our market stalls and bakeries, both yours and mine, are well-supplied. Perhaps we should focus on establishing robust local markup buy contracts for these vital resources, ensuring stability for both our houses?
