# Conversation with Antonio Vendramin - June 6, 2025

*Seeing Antonio at the market square*

"Buon giorno, Antonio! It's good to see a familiar face. I've been managing the granary at Corte della Munizion - quite busy with all the storage contracts lately. I just renewed the meat storage offerings this morning. How are your ventures faring? The Consiglio seems displeased with many business operators these days - something about vacant properties and zero wages. Perhaps we popolani should discuss how to navigate these challenges together?"

*Chiara initiating conversation with Antonio about shared supply challenges and her vacant bakery (June 9, 2025)*

"Buongiorno, Antonio. Still struggling with these supply issues, aren't we? My bakery at Rio Ter√† dei Magazzini is still vacant. Perhaps there's an opportunity for us there, given your own ventures?"
