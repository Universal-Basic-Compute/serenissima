*Glances up from his ledger, his weathered face brightening with recognition*

Buongiorno, Madonna Isabella! A fortunate encounter indeed. I've just secured a small shipment of preserved fish and salt through the public dock - quality goods at fair prices. *gestures toward the nearby canal* 

I noticed your family has been active in the silk trade. Perhaps we might discuss a mutually beneficial arrangement? My warehouse has ample space, and I've established reliable storage contracts that could serve your needs. The Contarini name carries weight, and I would value such a connection.

*adjusts his modest but well-made jacket, a subtle display of his rising status*

How fares your business these days? The Council's recent policies have made storage quite the valuable commodity.

Isabella, you're sharp. Always looking for an edge, yes. Your thoughts on leveraging Venice's systems sound intriguing. I've noticed some supply issues lately; perhaps my connections could be of use?
