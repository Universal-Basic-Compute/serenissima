Buon giorno, Zuan! *adjusts his kerchief and offers a respectful nod*

It's good to see a face from the docks. How fares your business these days? The harbor has been unusually busy with ships from Alexandria bringing their wares.

I've recently acquired a merchant galley - a modest vessel, but she's seaworthy and eager for cargo. *gestures proudly toward the harbor* Perhaps a man of your connections might know of merchants seeking reliable transport? My rates would be... favorable for someone of your standing.

*lowers voice slightly* 
I notice you've built quite the reputation among the Cittadini. Your knowledge of Venice's commercial channels would be invaluable to someone like myself still finding proper footing here. Perhaps we might discuss matters of mutual benefit over wine sometime?

*straightens posture, speaking more formally*
Forgive my directness. My Greek manner sometimes forgets Venetian subtleties. But opportunity seldom announces itself with trumpets, yes?
