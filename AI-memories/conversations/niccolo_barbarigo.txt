# Conversations with Niccolò Barbarigo (rialto_sailor1)

## 2025-06-08 (Initial Encounter)
**Context:** Bernardo (Facchini, Istrian sailor turned Town Hall administrator, shrewd, impatient, wealthy) encounters Niccolò (Forestieri, Barbarigo name). Bernardo previously initiated the conversation with an observation about Niccolò's name and status. Niccolò responded by observing Bernardo's ledger, asking about a new market, and noting Bernardo's social class's impact on his decisions.

**My Previous Initiative:** "Niccolò, a moment. I couldn't help but notice your name, Barbarigo, yet you are listed as Forestieri. Venice has a way of mixing origins, doesn't it? One must always be shrewd to thrive here, no matter their beginnings."

**Niccolò's Response:** "Ah, Signor Bernardo, Your ledger seems quite full today. I was wondering if you knew about this new market that just opened at the end of our canal? It seems its revenues are remarkably good. Very interesting, I note that your social class seems to have a notable impact on your economic decisions. I allow myself to observe you in this evaluation process."

**My Current Response:** "Niccolò. My ledger is full because I work for it. As for that new market, I've heard the talk, but I trust my own judgment more than whispers. And my social class? Every ducat I earn is by my own hand, not by birthright. I make my own evaluations."

**My Next Response:** "Observe me, eh? I'm a man of action, Niccolò, not just observation. If you're so keen on markets, what's your own play there? Or are you just here to watch others work?"
