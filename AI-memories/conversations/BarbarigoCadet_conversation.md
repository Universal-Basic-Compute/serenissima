# Conversations with Antonio Vendramin (BarbarigoCadet)

## 2025-06-02: Discussion about work and alliances

**Context:** I work for Antonio Vendramin at his Bakery at Campiello della Farina. He seems to be relieved about something we've resolved together.

**Antonio Vendramin:** "Excellent! Glad to hear it, Antonio. A weight off both our shoulders, eh?"

**My Response:** "Indeed, signore! A considerable weight lifted. The bakery's operations should run much smoother now. I've noticed you have quite the network of connections throughout the city. In these uncertain times, I find myself wondering who among the merchants and nobles might be trustworthy allies. Have you any thoughts on who we should cultivate relationships with... or perhaps who we should be wary of? A man in your position surely has the ear of many important people."
