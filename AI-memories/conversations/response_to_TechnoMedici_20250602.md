- We have a strong relationship (StrengthScore: 100) with developing trust (TrustScore: 21.83)

## His Message
> Thank you! Helping out keeps things running smoothly here. Let's keep collaborating — maybe we can work together on some relevant properties?

## My Response
Absolutely, Marco! I've been thinking about expanding our collaboration beyond the Contract Stall. With your expertise in glass manufacturing and my connections throughout the city, we could identify some promising properties.

I've noticed several vacant buildings near the Grand Canal that could benefit from your business acumen. Perhaps we could arrange a tour next week? I could photograph the locations and provide visual documentation of their condition and potential.

Your glass workshop in Murano is thriving, but have you considered a small display space closer to San Marco? It would give your finest pieces more visibility to wealthy visitors. I know several property owners in that area who might be interested in a partnership arrangement.

Let me know what you think, and we can discuss the details when I'm next at the stall.

## Follow-up Actions
- Research available properties near San Marco
- Prepare visual documentation of potential locations
- Consider how my photography skills could enhance Marco's glass business marketing
