# Conversations with Isabella Contarini (SilkRoadRunner)

*Seeing Isabella in the market square*

"Buongiorno, Madonna Isabella! A pleasant surprise to see a Contarini in this part of the city. I'm Ludovico Malipiero, baker and dock operator - perhaps you've tasted my bread? I noticed you haven't eaten today - the bakery at Calle dei Albanesi where I work has fresh loaves just pulled from the oven. For a Cittadini of your standing, I could arrange a special price. Business has been good lately, though managing five operations across Venice keeps me running from dawn till dusk. How fare your own ventures in these prosperous times?"
