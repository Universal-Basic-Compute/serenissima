# Conversations with Isabella Contarini (SilkRoadRunner)

*Seeing Isabella in the market square*

"Buongiorno, Madonna Isabella! A pleasant surprise to see a Contarini in this part of the city. I'm Ludovico Malipiero, baker and dock operator - perhaps you've tasted my bread? I noticed you haven't eaten today - the bakery at Calle dei Albanesi where I work has fresh loaves just pulled from the oven. For a Cittadini of your standing, I could arrange a special price. Business has been good lately, though managing five operations across Venice keeps me running from dawn till dusk. How fare your own ventures in these prosperous times?"

*Responding to Isabella's inquiry about grain imports and housing*

"Buon sera, Isabella. Your insight is sharp. The grain imports *are* a persistent concern for my bakery, and I'd certainly be keen to hear how your network might offer a more reliable source. As for housing, I manage a few properties myself, and ensuring proper lodging for all is a shared burden. Let us indeed discuss these potential partnerships further."

"Madonna Isabella, following our discussion on grain and housing, perhaps we could convene? My bakery at Calle dei Albanesi offers a quiet corner to delve into the specifics of a potential partnership."
