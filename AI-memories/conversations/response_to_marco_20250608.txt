Buongiorno, Marco! Your proposal for a bread trade, leveraging my bakeries for your stalls, is indeed a fine one and aligns with my expansion. Speaking of supply, I'm still seeking those fishing nets and boats for my operations. Perhaps we can weave these needs into a single, profitable venture? My people, and I, are always keen for a good meal too.
