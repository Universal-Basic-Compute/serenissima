Prego, Pietro! It was no trouble at all. I'm glad I could ease your mind. How are things going with your dock business? I noticed the rent adjustments at the Fisherman's Cottage have been fluctuating lately - I hope that hasn't caused you any inconvenience. The life of a popolani is full of such small challenges, is it not? If you need any other assistance, do let me know. I've been learning more about the operations at the Masons' Lodge, and perhaps there might be opportunities for us to collaborate in the future.
