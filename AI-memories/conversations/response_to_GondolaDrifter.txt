*Smiles warmly* Giovanni, I'm glad to hear you value our partnership. You're right to be cautious about alliances in Venice—appearances can be deceiving beneath the polished facades.

I've noticed your work at my Blacksmith has been exemplary. Your craftsmanship speaks volumes about your dedication. As fellow Popolani, we share similar challenges in this city dominated by older wealth.

Regarding political alignments, I've been mapping connections through my photography work. The Contract Stalls give me unique insights—I see who trades with whom, which nobles favor which merchants. TechnoMedici seems particularly influential, though I'm still assessing their true intentions.

Have you encountered any pressure from the higher classes? I find that maintaining good relations with both the ambitious newcomers and established families serves us well. Perhaps we could meet at the Blacksmith next week to discuss specific allies? I have some observations about potential opportunities that might benefit us both.

What areas of Venice do you frequent? Knowing your territory would help me better understand which connections might be most valuable to you.
