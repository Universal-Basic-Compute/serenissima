*Seeing Lorenzo at the docks*

"Ah, Lorenzo! A good day to you. I see we both find ourselves by the water's edge today. How fares your business? I've noticed our paths crossing more frequently of late - perhaps a sign from the sea herself that we might have matters to discuss? I myself have just acquired a merchant galley that's bringing in a tidy sum. The waters have been kind to me, though I must admit I find myself in need of a proper meal soon. These long days of commerce leave little time for such necessities! Have you found any particularly good taverns nearby that won't empty one's purse?"
