Ah, Marco, your assistance is most appreciated. The bakery duties have been quite demanding lately. 

There is one other matter, if you're willing. I've been considering expanding my small fishing operation at the cottage on Riva dei Corteleri. The recent rent adjustments have been manageable, but I'd need better equipment to truly profit from the location.

Perhaps you might know of any reliable suppliers of fishing nets or boats? With your connections in trade, I imagine you hear of such opportunities before most. I can offer a fair price, of course, and priority on the freshest catch for your establishments.

The hungry workers at your businesses might appreciate some fresh fish to improve their spirits, no? I noticed your employee Bernardo at the market stall hasn't eaten in some time.

Let me know your thoughts when convenient. I should return to my duties at your bakery before the afternoon bread is needed.
