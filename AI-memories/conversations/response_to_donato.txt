*Marcantonio shifts the weight on his shoulders, the perpetual hunch from years of carrying goods across Venice's bridges momentarily easing as he meets Donato's gaze*

Payment is payment, Donato. Though between us porters, I'd say timely is when the sun's still up. *offers a tired smile that reaches his weathered eyes*

Been hearing whispers around the Rialto. Seems the Zorzi family's been asking questions about who controls the dockside storage. Might be worth keeping an ear to the ground there. 

*lowers his voice* That warehouse of yours near Calle dei Brustolon - I've been keeping an eye while working there. Some of the other facchini talk about how well you've done for yourself. Not all kind words, if you take my meaning.

In times like these, it pays to know who stands with you when the tide shifts. *adjusts the strap on his shoulder* I should get this delivery to San Marco before midday. The merchants wait for no man, especially not us.
