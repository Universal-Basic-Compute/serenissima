# Conversation with Marco Venier (TechnoMedici)

## Initial Meeting - 2025-06-09
*Context: Initiating a conversation with Marco Venier (TechnoMedici) to discuss shared market challenges, particularly concerning resource supply, given both our current problems with procurement and his recent import delays. As a Popolani merchant, I aim to explore collaborative solutions that benefit my own operations and strengthen economic ties with a Cittadini.*

Marco, good day. These market disruptions are proving troublesome for many, myself included. Perhaps we should put our heads together on securing supplies?
