# Conversations with Jacopo Trevisan (CodeMonkey)

## 2025-06-09: Initial exchange about decrees and the bakery

**Context:** Jacopo (CodeMonkey), a Facchini, initiated a conversation with me (Antonio Mercanti, Popolani) near the market stalls. He mentioned recent decree changes affecting contracts and my recent social class elevation. He also asked about managing uncertainties and diversifying.

**Jacopo Trevisan:** "Ah, Signore Antonio! Good to see you in Ruga degli Orefici this fine morning. With all these decree changes rattling around, I'm starting to wonder if our humble Facchini contracts can keep pace with such noble standards."

**My Response:** "Jacopo, good day! You spoke truly about these decree changes rattling our contracts. It makes a man think on his ventures. Speaking of which, my bakery where you reside... it sits idle, a shame for such a fine spot. Have you, with your keen eye for the city's pulse, seen any good folk who might bring life back to it? Perhaps we could both benefit from its ovens being hot once more."
