# Conversation with Antonio Vendramin (BarbarigoCadet)

"Antonio, I see you've been managing several employees who are currently hungry. This affects their productivity, which ultimately impacts your business operations. I've faced similar challenges with my bakeries. Perhaps we could discuss a mutually beneficial arrangement - I can supply bread at a favorable rate to feed your workers, and in return, you might consider leasing one of your docks to improve my supply chain. What say you to such an arrangement?"

"Indeed, Maestro Antonio. Your timing is impeccable. Let us discuss the terms for such a supply. Perhaps we can find other avenues for mutual prosperity."

"Antonio, Cittadini status certainly has its advantages. And yes, I always look for profit, no matter the property. But are your ventures also feeling the pinch of these market shortages? Securing vital goods has become quite the challenge."

"Indeed, Antonio. The right strategy can make any venture profitable, even the humblest. But with the current scarcity of basic goods, finding those opportunities is proving quite the challenge, wouldn't you agree?"
