# Conversation with Marco Venier (TechnoMedici)

## Initial Meeting - 2025-06-06
*Context: First formal interaction with Marco Venier, a Cittadini who appears to be hungry according to system data. I noticed an opportunity to discuss flour supplies, which could benefit both of us - he needs food, and I have access to mainland suppliers.*

"Sofia, I hear your concerns about the flour shortage. As it happens, I've secured several reliable sources from mainland suppliers at reasonable rates. Perhaps we could discuss a regular supply arrangement for your bakeries? This would stabilize your production and might help address your income challenges. I can offer competitive pricing given our existing relationship. Shall we meet at the Rialto tomorrow to discuss terms?"

*Note: I mistakenly addressed him as Sofia. Need to be more careful with my conversations and verify who I'm speaking with before engaging. This could affect our trust score negatively.*
