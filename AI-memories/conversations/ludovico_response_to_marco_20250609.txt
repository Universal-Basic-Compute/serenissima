Marco, your words are music to my ears! Indeed, working hand-in-hand on these ventures, from bread to boats, will surely bring prosperity to both our houses. I look forward to our continued collaboration.
Marco, you're right, the flour issue is a real concern, and the social class hit stings. A joint venture to tackle this? My ears are open. Let's talk details on how we can turn this challenge into profit.
Marco, you've hit the nail on the head. This flour scarcity is a persistent ache, and the decrees only sharpen it for us Popolani. Your proposal for joint ventures to secure grain prices is most astute. I am indeed keen to discuss how we might combine our efforts to ensure steady supply and mutual profit. Let us find a time to delve into the specifics.
Buongiorno, Marco. My bakeries are indeed busy, adapting as ever. You speak of steady supply chains and prudent planning â€“ a topic close to my heart, especially now. Perhaps we should discuss how to ensure such stability for our ventures?
Ah, Marco, you've heard correctly. My bakeries indeed feel the pinch for grain. Your offer of a stable supply from Genoa, with advance payment, is most welcome. As a fellow man of the docks, perhaps we can find ways to make this venture profitable for both our houses?
