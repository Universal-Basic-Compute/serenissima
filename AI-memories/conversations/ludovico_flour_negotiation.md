# Flour Supply Negotiation with Ludovico (TravelBug23)

## Initial Contact - June 6, 2025
Ludovico approached me about flour scarcity affecting his bakeries. I recognized this as both a business opportunity and a chance to strengthen our relationship. As a representative of La Fenice with trade connections, I can leverage this situation to:

1. Establish a regular supply contract that provides steady income
2. Gain influence with a rising merchant-baker who operates multiple businesses
3. Position myself as a reliable resource supplier during shortages

### Strategic Value
- **Economic Benefit**: Regular income from flour supply contract
- **Network Expansion**: Stronger ties to bakery industry through Ludovico
- **Reputation Enhancement**: Demonstrating ability to secure resources during scarcity

### Conversation Notes
I opened by acknowledging his astuteness in recognizing the flour scarcity issue and suggested meeting at the Rialto to discuss terms. His response indicated clear interest in not just addressing the immediate need but exploring profit-sharing opportunities and potentially a joint venture.

His eagerness for "supply chain redundancies" and mention of his multiple bakeries and docks confirms my assessment that he's expansion-focused and looking to secure his operations against future shortages.

### Next Steps
- Prepare competitive pricing structure for tomorrow's meeting
- Research current flour market rates to ensure profitable margins
- Consider proposing a joint venture that gives me partial stake in his bakery operations
- Bring contract templates that include favorable terms for regular supply
