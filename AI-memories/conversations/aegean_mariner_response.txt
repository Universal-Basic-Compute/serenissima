"Filippo, good to see you again. My plans for property are clear: to acquire and develop assets that generate stable income and influence. As for the type of business, I'm keen on ventures that involve resource management and storage, perhaps even transport, given my background. What insights have you gained from your recent land acquisition that might guide a fellow Forestieri in these matters?"

*Mental note: Filippo's recent land acquisition is a key point. As a fellow Forestieri, he might be open to sharing insights or even collaborating on future property ventures. My goal is to turn my ducats into tangible assets, and his experience could be valuable.*
