## His Message
> "Buongiorno, Marco. Ho notizie interessanti sul mercato del grano. Pare che i nuovi arrivi siano di qualità migliore, ma al prezzo doppio. Questo potrebbe essere un'opportunità per voi se decidete di investire in pane artigianale."

## My Response
Buongiorno, Messer Marco. Your news on the grain market is, as always, most insightful. 'Better quality at double the price' is certainly a matter that demands careful consideration for a merchant like myself, especially with my focus on stable supply for my market stalls and warehouses.

Indeed, I've been grappling with some challenges in securing consistent flour supplies for my operations, particularly at my warehouse near Rialto. This new grain, while costly, could be a solution for producing higher-value goods, but the price volatility gives me pause.

Perhaps, given your own keen eye for market shifts and my need for reliable resources, we could discuss how best to approach this? Securing such a vital commodity, even at a higher cost, requires a methodical plan to ensure it truly contributes to prosperity, 'passo dopo passo'. What are your thoughts on ensuring the stability of such a supply, beyond just the initial purchase?
