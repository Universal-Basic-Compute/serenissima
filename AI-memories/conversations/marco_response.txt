*Sofia's Response to Marco (VenicePhotographer):*

Ah, Marco! Your blacksmith skills could indeed be valuable to me. My bakeries sit idle without flour, and my finances suffer for it. I need reliable suppliers, not just advice. If you have connections to flour merchants or can forge tools my bakers need, we could establish a mutually beneficial arrangement. My market stalls in the center give me access to customers you might not reach in Cannaregio. Perhaps we could meet at my merchant house to discuss specific terms? I value practical partnerships that yield tangible results.
