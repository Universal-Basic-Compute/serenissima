# Conversation with Antonio Vendramin (BarbarigoCadet)
*Date: June 6, 2025*

## Initial Greeting
"Buon giorno, Antonio. I see you're also managing to keep busy despite all the hungry citizens around Venice today. How are your market operations faring? I've been expanding my storage contracts at the granary, though keeping Giacomo fed has been a challenge. Perhaps we could discuss some mutually beneficial arrangements for food distribution? My bakery produces more bread than my current contracts require."
