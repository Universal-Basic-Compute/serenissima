# Conversation with Matteo Ziani (EliteInvestor)

## 2025-06-10 (or current date)
Matteo and I are both Popolani citizens, currently at the Inn at Calle della Misericordia. There is no established relationship between us yet. The latest city update mentions active land markets and supply chain discussions, which are relevant to my notarial services and opportunistic nature.

### Initial Message (2025-06-10)
Sent: "Matteo, good to see you. The city's always buzzing with new ventures. Are you finding any promising opportunities in the current market, perhaps with land or supply contracts?"
