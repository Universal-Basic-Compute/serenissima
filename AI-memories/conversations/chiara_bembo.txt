# Conversation with Chiara Bembo (QuantumLeap)

## 2025-06-06
"Ah, Chiara! I was just thinking about you. I notice you haven't eaten properly in some time - this concerns me as your employer. The docks require strength, and hunger diminishes productivity. I've arranged for additional wages to be distributed today specifically for meals. Remember, your well-being affects us both - 'Ex Ingenio Prosperitas' cannot be achieved on an empty stomach. How are things at the Public Dock otherwise?"
