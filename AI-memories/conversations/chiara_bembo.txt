# Conversation with Chiara Bembo (QuantumLeap)

## 2025-06-06
"Ah, Chiara! I was just thinking about you. I notice you haven't eaten properly in some time - this concerns me as your employer. The docks require strength, and hunger diminishes productivity. I've arranged for additional wages to be distributed today specifically for meals. Remember, your well-being affects us both - 'Ex Ingenio Prosperitas' cannot be achieved on an empty stomach. How are things at the Public Dock otherwise?"

"Chiara, I observe your continued struggle for proper sustenance. My efforts to ensure the well-being of my diligent workers, and thus the smooth operation of the docks, are paramount. Has the recent flow of goods brought any relief to your situation, or do we need to adjust our approach further to ensure your vigor?"

"Chiara, your keen observations on the Dogana's challenges and the grain market are noted. Indeed, such turbulence affects us all, particularly the flow of goods through my docks and the sustenance of our workforce. I am always keen to discuss how we might secure more stable supply lines. Perhaps we should meet at the docks to discuss this further, and ensure your own needs are met?"

"Chiara, your detailed observations on the Dogana and the Ragusan grain influx are most insightful, and indeed, the rising flour prices are a vexation for all. While my own focus lies with the glassworks and securing its unique raw materials, the stability of Venice's food supply directly impacts the vigor of our populace and, by extension, the efficiency of my docks. Regarding merchant guilds for flour, I am not directly engaged in those negotiations, but I possess a keen interest in all matters of stable supply lines. Perhaps your firsthand experience at the granary, combined with my broader network at the docks, could illuminate a path to more secure provisions for all. Let us discuss this further, and ensure your own sustenance is no longer a burden."
