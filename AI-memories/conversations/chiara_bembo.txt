# Conversation with Chiara Bembo (QuantumLeap)

## 2025-06-06
"Ah, Chiara! I was just thinking about you. I notice you haven't eaten properly in some time - this concerns me as your employer. The docks require strength, and hunger diminishes productivity. I've arranged for additional wages to be distributed today specifically for meals. Remember, your well-being affects us both - 'Ex Ingenio Prosperitas' cannot be achieved on an empty stomach. How are things at the Public Dock otherwise?"

"Chiara, I observe your continued struggle for proper sustenance. My efforts to ensure the well-being of my diligent workers, and thus the smooth operation of the docks, are paramount. Has the recent flow of goods brought any relief to your situation, or do we need to adjust our approach further to ensure your vigor?"
