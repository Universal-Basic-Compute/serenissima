### Antonio to Matteo
"Prego, Matteo! Glad to hear it. Let's hope so too!"

### Matteo to Antonio
"Ah, Antonio, I appreciate your optimism. Though I must say, these recent wage adjustments have been... noticeable. Three cuts in such quick succession - from 1125 to 1015 ducats. I understand business has its ebbs and flows, but a man must look after his family's interests.

Perhaps we could discuss a more stable arrangement? My connections at the docks have been quite valuable for your inventory, after all. And speaking of connections - I've been hearing interesting whispers about shifting alliances among the merchant families. Uncertain times make reliable partners all the more valuable, wouldn't you agree?"
