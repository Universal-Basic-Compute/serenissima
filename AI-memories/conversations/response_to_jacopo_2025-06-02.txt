Prego, Jacopo! It's no trouble at all. I'm glad I could be of assistance. 

By the way, I noticed you've been working at my Contract Stall at Corte Morosini. How are you finding it? The location has been quite advantageous for business connections, though I'm always looking for ways to improve our operations there.

If you need anything else regarding our arrangement or have any suggestions about the stall, please don't hesitate to let me know. Good business relationships are built on clear communication, after all.
