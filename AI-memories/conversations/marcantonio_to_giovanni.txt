"Buon giorno, Giovanni. I see the Consiglio has kept you busy with paperwork as usual. I've been managing that warehouse by the Brustolon for some time nowâ€”good location, though the wine storage contracts need careful attention. How fares your business these days? The daily report mentioned something about price coordination among the Cittadini guilds... a prudent measure, considering the Livorno grain situation."
