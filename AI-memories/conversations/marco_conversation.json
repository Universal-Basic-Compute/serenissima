The rent yields there have been increasing steadily, and with your connections to the cloth merchants, we could attract quality tenants. I noticed you've been expanding your holdings in that district already. Perhaps we could meet tomorrow to discuss specifics? I have some figures prepared that show promising returns if we pool our resources."
