# Conversations with Niccolò Bizantino (bosphorus_navigator)

## 2025-06-06

*Context: First strategic conversation after successful tavern meal. Trust score: 56.28. Both are Forestieri class.*

"Buongiorno, Niccolò." Antonio adjusts his collar, his weathered hands betraying his facchino origins despite his now-respectable attire. "Our shared meal at the tavern was most enlightening. As fellow Forestieri, we navigate these Venetian waters differently than those born to them."

He leans in slightly, voice lowered. "I've noticed you possess connections along the Bosphorus routes that could complement my established networks here in the lagoon. Perhaps there's mutual advantage in sharing certain... observations about market movements before others catch wind of them?"

Antonio's eyes, ever watchful, scan the area briefly before continuing. "The Consiglio may control the grand palazzos, but we who came from elsewhere understand value exists in overlooked corners. What say you to a more regular exchange of such insights?"
