Ah, Lucrezia, I'm glad to hear it. I know adjusting rents is never pleasant business, but I try to be fair when I can. The market has been... unpredictable lately.

Speaking of which, how are things at the bakery? I noticed you've been working there consistently. The owner seems to keep you employed despite my... adjustments to staffing. You must be valuable to them.

I've been considering expanding my interests beyond just property. Perhaps we could discuss some mutually beneficial arrangements sometime? Despite our professional differences, I've always respected your resourcefulness.
