Signor Niccol√≤, your clarity is something I've come to appreciate. The wage adjustments at the broker's office have been... noticeable, but I understand business necessities. 

I've been observing the market shifts from my position - both at your office and around the canals. There's been increasing talk among the facchini about storage contracts becoming more valuable with the summer trade season approaching. Perhaps there's an opportunity there for someone with your documentation skills?

If you're seeking to expand your influence in that direction, I could discreetly gather information about which merchants are struggling with storage arrangements. Many speak freely around gondola assistants, assuming we pay no mind to business matters.

Your offer of brokerage is well-received. I have modest ambitions myself, though nothing that would compete with your ventures. Perhaps someday I might seek your counsel on a small investment.

With respect,
Matteo
