Ah, a fellow outsider in this labyrinth of canals and ambition! *adjusts posture slightly* 

"Greetings, Taddeo. Indeed, we share the perspective of newcomers to this most... particular Republic. I find myself curious about your Dalmatian ventures. Perhaps there's mutual benefit in our acquaintance - I've been studying the waterways and local customs with great interest. What brings you to seek me out specifically? *slight calculating smile* I imagine a trader of your background must have keen insights into which markets here remain... undervalued."

*Mental note: A potential ally from across the Adriatic could provide alternative trade connections if properly cultivated. His approach suggests he sees value in me beyond my current station.*
