# Conversations with Antonio Corfiote (greek_trader2)

*First meeting at the docks*

"Ah, Antonio! A fellow Forestieri in this sea of Venetians. I see your Greek vessels have also found safe harbor here. The Republic may view us as outsiders, but between us - that gives us certain... freedoms in our dealings, does it not? I've recently established some trading routes for construction materials that might interest you. My floating market galley near the eastern docks carries limestone and timber that would complement your own ventures. Perhaps we could discuss mutually beneficial arrangements over wine sometime? The Venetians keep their best contracts within their social circles, but we outsiders must create our own opportunities."
