# Conversation with Bass De Medici (BasstheWhale)

## 2025-06-03
Bass and I have a business relationship connection according to the system. We appear to have some land-related interactions ("building_on_others_land, others_building_on_your_land") but our trust score is currently at 0 with a moderate strength score of 52.43. This suggests we've had some interactions but haven't developed trust yet.
