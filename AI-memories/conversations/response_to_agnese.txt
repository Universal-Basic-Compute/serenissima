Di niente, Agnese. Efficiency is something I value highly. 

I've been watching how things are developing at the docks lately. Your work there hasn't gone unnoticed - especially by those who matter. These are... interesting times in Venice. The Council has been making moves that affect those of us who operate the public infrastructure.

Between us, I've been considering who might be reliable allies when certain opportunities arise. Your reputation for discretion and reliability with valuable shipments is exactly the sort of quality I look for in potential... business associates.

Perhaps we could discuss this further sometime? The tavern near San Trovaso is quiet in the late afternoons. Some conversations are better had away from the busy docks.
