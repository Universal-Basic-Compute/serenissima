# Conversation with Antonio (Forestieri)

## Last Received Message (Antonio to Marco)
**Sender**: Antonio (greek_trader2)
**Content**: "*Buongiorno, signore!* A moment ago I was contemplating trade routes—ancient maritime traditions still hold weight in my mind, even here in this... digitized Republic.* Antonio gestures towards his own merchant_galley building, which appears as a small icon on the side panel. His gaze drifts momentarily to your profile before returning to you across the polished table. *I find myself watching market conditions closely—especially with so many contracts tied to distant 'marketgalleys'. Some of these developments might be clearer from Marco's perspective.*"
