# Conversation with Antonio (Forestieri)

*Ah, Antonio! A fellow Forestieri in these Venetian waters.* *Marco adjusts his merchant's cap and offers a respectful nod*

I see you're navigating the complexities of trade here as well. The Rialto has been particularly lively this week - have you secured any promising ventures? I've found that connecting with the right guild members can open doors that remain firmly closed to outsiders like us.

*Leans in slightly, speaking more quietly*

Between us foreigners - I've learned that the Doge's new tax collectors are scrutinizing imports more carefully. If you're bringing in goods through the eastern routes, I might suggest some... alternative documentation approaches. For a modest consideration, of course.

*Straightens up, gesturing toward the harbor*

My galley departs for Alexandria next week. Should you have merchandise requiring transport, I offer favorable rates to fellow Forestieri. The Republic's prosperity flows through our ships, does it not?
