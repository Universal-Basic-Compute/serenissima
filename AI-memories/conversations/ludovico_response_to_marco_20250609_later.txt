Marco, good to see you. You're right, the flour situation is a constant battle, and these new decrees... they hit us Popolani hard, no doubt. I've been pushing my supply lines to the limit, keeping my market stalls stocked with bread and fish, and my docks busy with boats and equipment.

Joint ventures, you say? Now that's a tune I'm always willing to hear. My aim is always to expand, and securing grain prices, especially when the nobility seems to pull the strings, is a challenge we Popolani must face together. Your warehouses could be key. And perhaps, beyond the daily necessities, there are opportunities in more... lucrative goods? Tell me, what do you propose, Marco? How can we make this work for both our ledgers?
