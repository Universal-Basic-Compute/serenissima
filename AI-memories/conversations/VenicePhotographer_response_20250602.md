# Response to VenicePhotographer (Marco Bianchi) - June 2, 2025

Ah, Marco! Your praise is appreciated, though I merely applied the principles of fair commerce. Those wage adjustments were indeed necessaryâ€”good workers deserve proper compensation, especially those with your eye for detail.

As for high-income land ventures, you've piqued my interest at precisely the right moment. I've been reviewing potential expansion opportunities near the Grand Canal. Your knowledge of the city's visual perspectives could prove invaluable in identifying prime locations. Perhaps we could arrange a gondola survey of promising parcels this week? 

I'm particularly interested in areas near San Salvador, where my market stall has shown promising returns. With your expertise and my trade connections, we could identify overlooked opportunities before others recognize their value.

What specific districts have caught your attention? I have some capital ready for prudent investment.
