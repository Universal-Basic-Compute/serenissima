Ah, Antonio! Your timing is fortuitous. Indeed, I've noticed some... irregularities in the mainland supply routes. Several of my contacts report increased Genoese activity along our northern trade corridors.

If you're concerned about flour, I may have a solution. I recently secured a small warehouse near Fondamenta della Pescaria that could serve both our interests. Perhaps we could discuss combining our resources? With your connections and my storage capacity, we might weather whatever disruptions are coming.

(gestures to a nearby table with better privacy)

Shall we discuss the particulars? I believe there's profit to be made for both our houses in these uncertain times.
