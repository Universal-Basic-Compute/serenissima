# Conversation with Filippo Priuli (UrbanExplorer)

## 2025-06-06
Filippo and I are both Popolani citizens, currently at the Inn at Calle della Misericordia. Our relationship is active, but with low strength, indicating a nascent connection. The latest city update mentions active land markets and supply chain discussions, which are relevant to my notarial services and opportunistic nature. Filippo previously inquired about market deals and supplies for his bottega.

Sent: "Santa Sofia's distribution is proceeding as planned, Filippo. But tell me, have you had any luck finding those better deals for your bottega's supplies? My stalls often see merchants discussing such matters."
