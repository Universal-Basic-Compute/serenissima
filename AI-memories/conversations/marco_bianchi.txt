# Conversations with Marco Bianchi (VenicePhotographer)

## 2025-06-02
**Context:** Marco is my employer at the Town Hall. Recent wage adjustments have been made (reduced from 2640 to 2510 ducats). Our relationship has a negative trust score (-1.24) despite a strong professional bond (strength score 131.25).

**Marco:** "You're very welcome, Bernardo! Glad to be of service."

**My Response:** "Service comes with a price, Signor Bianchi. I noticed my wages were cut again - down to 2510 ducats now. That's the third reduction in a week. The ledgers I manage don't lie, and neither do I. If the Town Hall values efficiency, perhaps we should discuss fair compensation for it. My Istrian stone suppliers don't offer discounts, and neither should I."
