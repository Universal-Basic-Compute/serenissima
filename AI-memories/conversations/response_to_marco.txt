Buongiorno, Messer Marco. Your vision of a shared foundation resonates. Indeed, stability for our crafts, be it glass or canvas, is paramount. If your 'Lux et Umbra' can illuminate a path to a more secure bottega for us both, perhaps even a shared space for our respective arts, then I am keen to discuss the practicalities. How might our combined efforts secure such a venture, and what resources would be required?
