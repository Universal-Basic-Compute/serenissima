Buongiorno, Messer Marco. You speak of Cannaregio and the Consiglio's efforts there due to these troublesome trade disruptions. Indeed, such instability weighs heavily on us artisans, especially when securing the very materials for my Masons' Lodge. I find myself constantly reviewing my import contracts for timber, bricks, and sand, ensuring the flow remains steady.

As for available parcels... I confess, my gaze has been fixed more on the immediate needs of my craft and my current operations. And, between us, even a meticulous artisan finds it hard to focus on new ventures when one's own belly is empty, and my worker at the lodge feels the same pinch. Perhaps, Messer Marco, our shared challenges in securing reliable supplies are a more fruitful topic for discussion? Your own diverse ventures must surely feel the strain of these disrupted channels as well.
