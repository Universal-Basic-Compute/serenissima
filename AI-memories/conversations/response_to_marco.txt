*Chiara straightens her posture slightly, her expression a careful blend of professional courtesy and measured caution as she meets Marco's gaze*

Marco, your assistance has indeed been... adequate. *A hint of a smile touches her lips, acknowledging his humor about noble standards*

My ventures persist despite the challenges. The bakery continues to draw steady patronage, though I notice your recent wage adjustments at the dock have affected my daily calculations. Convenient timing, wouldn't you say? *She taps her finger thoughtfully on her own ledger*

I've observed similar patterns with other business operators. These small adjustments compound quickly in Venice's economy. One must wonder who benefits most when wages fluctuate so regularly.

*She lowers her voice slightly*

The hunger situation at the dock hasn't escaped my notice either. Productivity suffers when workers can't afford to eat properly. Perhaps this is something we should discuss more directly, as it affects both our interests.

I've been mapping connections between various guild members and merchants lately. It seems prudent in these times to understand where true alliances lie. The Consiglio's recent rent adjustments suggest they're testing the market's tolerance.

*She studies his reaction carefully*

Tell me, Marco, beyond our professional arrangement, where do you see your position in Venice's changing landscape? I find it increasingly valuable to know who stands where when the tides shift.
