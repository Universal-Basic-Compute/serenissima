Marco, your help has been invaluable. The blacksmith work has been steady, though I noticed the wage adjustments recently. Times are changing in Venice, aren't they?

I've been thinking about our arrangement. With all these automated adjustments happening around us, it might be wise for us popolani to look out for each other more deliberately. I've noticed several citizens making strategic alliances lately.

The new tenant at my Fisherman's Cottage - Tiziano Bertucci - mentioned something interesting about the guild structures forming. Have you heard anything about this? Perhaps we could discuss it when you next visit the blacksmith.

I'm also considering expanding my operations at the Contract Stall. If you have any insights on which goods are moving well these days, I'd appreciate the guidance.
