Ah, Marco! Your timing is impeccable as always. I've been meaning to discuss the flour supply situation with someone who understands the intricacies of the market. My bakeries have been struggling with inconsistent deliveries. Perhaps we could arrange a more... reliable arrangement? One that benefits us both, naturally. The Consiglio's recent adjustments to lease prices have created interesting opportunities for those of us who know where to look.
