Buongiorno, Marco. You are well-informed about my bakery's situation. Indeed, the Bakery at Rio Ter√† dei Magazzini is vacant. Your need for temporary storage is quite timely. Perhaps we can discuss how my space might serve your needs, especially with the grain market in mind? A mutually beneficial arrangement could be found.
