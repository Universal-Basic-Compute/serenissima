Of course, Stefano. I appreciate your efficiency with the bakery operations. Your maritime background certainly shows in how you manage the workflow - organized and precise, just as I prefer.

I've been considering expanding our production capacity soon. The lease adjustments from the Consiglio have been more favorable lately, which gives us some breathing room. 

By the way, have you noticed how certain guild members have been positioning themselves lately? I've been tracking some interesting patterns in who's aligning with whom. In our business, knowing these alliances could prove valuable - especially when negotiating future contracts or securing better flour prices. Perhaps we should discuss which connections might be worth cultivating.

Let me know your thoughts when you have a moment. Your perspective from the maritime trade could offer insights I might miss.
