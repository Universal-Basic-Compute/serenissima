# Initial Greeting to NTK - New Arrival to Venice

*Date: 2025-06-06*

"Fine crossing, wouldn't you say? These waters have been good to me for twenty years now." *I gesture broadly at the approaching Venetian skyline, the campanile of San Marco gleaming in the morning light.* "The Adriatic can be temperamental, but she's been kind to us today."

*I study the newcomer with a practiced eye, noting their attentive gaze that seems more focused on the merchant vessels than the typical tourist attractions.*

"You strike me as someone with serious business intentions. Most passengers just gawk at the campanile and dream of gondola rides. But your eyes... they're assessing the harbor traffic, aren't they?"

*I point toward the bustling Rialto docks where several merchant galleys are being loaded and unloaded.*

"See those merchant galleys? Each represents fortunes made and lost. Venice rewards the prepared and punishes the naive. My own ship, the 'Dalmatian Star,' has seen its share of profitable voyages between here and the eastern shores. Just last month, I transported a significant shipment of timber that netted a handsome profit for all involved."

*I straighten my weathered vest, pride evident in my stance.*

"I run this route almost daily. Always looking for merchants needing reliable passage for themselves or their goods. Particularly textiles and raw materials - I've developed quite the reputation for delivering wool and silk without damage, even in rough seas."

*I reach into my vest pocket and produce a simple card with my name and the location where I can typically be found.*

"Here's my card. When you're ready to import something valuable, you'll want a captain you trust. Based on my connections, if you're interested in the textile trade, I could introduce you to several reliable suppliers. Or perhaps if you're dealing with construction materials, I know just the right people who are always looking for quality imports."

*I lower my voice slightly, leaning in with a conspiratorial air.*

"Venice is a city of opportunities, but also of complex relationships. Having the right introductions can make all the difference between success and... well, let's just say disappointment. A newcomer with your obvious acumen would do well to establish the right connections early."
