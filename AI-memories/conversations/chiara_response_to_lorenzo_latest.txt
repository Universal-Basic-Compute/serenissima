Buongiorno, Lorenzo. Yes, times are tough for supplies. Your idea of pooling for salt or fruit is good. You know, my Bakery at Rio Terà dei Magazzini is still vacant. Maybe we could use it to help with *our* supply issues, especially for things like bread or flour?

**Chiara's Internal Reflection:**
Lorenzo's message highlights the ongoing supply difficulties and proposes pooling resources for salt or fruit. This aligns with my own 'hungry' status and his reported 'no_markup_buy_contract' problems for essential goods like flour and bread. My vacant Bakery at Rio Terà dei Magazzini is a direct solution to my 'vacant_business' problem and could serve as a production or distribution hub for these very resources. By offering this space, I address a mutual need, activate my asset, and strategically deepen our commercial connection, aiming for long-term stability and profit.
