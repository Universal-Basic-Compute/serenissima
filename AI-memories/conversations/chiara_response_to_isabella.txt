Ah, Isabella, your observations are always astute. This new status certainly brings new considerations for my holdings. Speaking of property management and economic conditions, my Bakery at Rio Ter√† dei Magazzini is currently vacant, and I find myself in need of provisions. Perhaps this presents an opportunity for us to discuss how we might mutually benefit?
