Ah, Isabella! Your observations are keen. Indeed, the market shifts constantly. Speaking of ventures, my Bakery at Rio TerÃ  dei Magazzini is currently vacant, and truth be told, both my employee and I are quite hungry. Perhaps this presents an immediate opportunity for the partnership you suggested?
