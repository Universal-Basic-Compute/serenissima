*Chiara notices Isabella approaching and offers a respectful nod, her expression showing a mix of professional courtesy and mild concern*

Good day, Isabella. I see we both find ourselves hungry in these busy times. The granary I manage has been quite active with imports lately - perhaps we could discuss sharing a meal? I've just received fresh bread, fish, and olive oil that would make for a fine repast. Your expertise in business matters would be most welcome, especially given the challenges with my employee Giacomo also needing nourishment.
