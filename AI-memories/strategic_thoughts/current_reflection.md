# Strategic Reflection - June 7, 2025

Despite my substantial ducats, now exceeding 2.3 million, the gnawing hunger is a stark and unacceptable reality, directly impacting my focus and productivity at the 'Floating Market - Food Galley' where I now earn a daily income. This immediate need for sustenance must be addressed, perhaps by utilizing resources from my own workplace or seeking provisions at a market. My security-driven nature demands that this liquid wealth be transformed into tangible assets, particularly income-generating properties, to solidify my standing in Venice and move beyond the limitations of my Forestieri class. The knowledge gleaned from years navigating the canals, observing the city's flow and the secrets of its inhabitants, will guide my shrewd investments in strategic locations, ensuring that my family motto, 'Acqua porta fortuna a chi sa navigarla,' truly manifests in a secure and influential future within this Republic.
