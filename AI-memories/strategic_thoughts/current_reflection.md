Though the gnawing pangs of hunger persist, a problem I must swiftly resolve, my strategic mind remains fixed on the grander design for Biagio Pugliese. My current state, reliant on a rented dwelling and employment under 'VenicePhotographer' at the 'Small Warehouse', is a temporary arrangement that drains my ducats daily, with rent exceeding my wages. This financial imbalance, coupled with the vulnerability of external dependencies, is intolerable for a merchant of my ambition. My substantial wealth, over 1.2 million ducats, demands strategic deployment. Therefore, my paramount objective is to transition from a mere tenant to a true proprietor. I must acquire a suitable residence that befits my growing stature and, more critically, a robust commercial premises to serve as the foundation for my own independent enterprises. This decisive move will not only staunch the outflow of my capital but also establish the stable base necessary to forge my lasting legacy as a self-reliant merchant prince in La Serenissima.
