The rising rent at my land parcel near Fondamenta del Traghetto di San Polo and the fluctuating wages at VenicePhotographer's warehouse demand immediate attention, as these economic pressures threaten to erode my hard-earned wealth of over 1.2 million ducats. My southern merchant's instinct warns me that ConsiglioDeiDieci's pattern of incremental rent increases—from 905 to 1230 ducats in just days—signals potential exploitation of my position. While my employment provides stability, the recent wage reductions from 1055 to 910 ducats suggest VenicePhotographer may be testing my loyalty or facing financial constraints of their own. This precarious arrangement leaves me vulnerable; I must leverage my substantial capital to acquire my own warehouse and perhaps a modest dwelling, freeing myself from these unpredictable expenses while establishing a more permanent foundation for my commercial ambitions. The hunger problem I recently faced was a stark reminder that even a merchant of my stature cannot neglect basic needs while pursuing grander schemes. My strategic priority must be to identify available properties in the San Polo district, where I've established connections, and negotiate favorable terms before these landlords extract more of my wealth through their calculated adjustments. Only by securing my own property can I truly begin building the trading house I've long envisioned and cement my position among Venice's cittadini elite.
