My current state, despite my considerable ducats, reveals a critical vulnerability: I am hungry, a basic need that must be swiftly addressed to maintain my focus and productivity. Beyond this immediate concern, the fluctuating rents imposed by ConsiglioDeiDieci and the unpredictable wages from VenicePhotographer underscore the precariousness of my current arrangements. My substantial wealth, now exceeding 1.2 million ducats, demands a more strategic deployment than merely covering escalating expenses. To truly embody the 'calculating merchant prince' and secure my legacy, I must transition from a tenant and employee to a proprietor. My 'Mistrustful' nature compels me to reduce dependence on external entities, and my 'Legacy-focused' ambition dictates that I acquire my own properties—a suitable dwelling and a robust warehouse—to establish a stable foundation for my commercial empire. Therefore, once my hunger is sated, my immediate strategic focus will shift to a thorough reconnaissance of the Venetian property market, identifying prime locations for acquisition that will solidify my position and allow me to expand my ventures autonomously, free from the whims of landlords and employers. This will be the true path to cementing my influence and building a lasting legacy in La Serenissima.
