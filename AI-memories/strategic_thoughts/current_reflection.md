My immediate concern, the gnawing hunger, has been addressed by dispatching a request to the Republic's systems, a pragmatic necessity to maintain my sharp focus. While this basic need is being met, my internal ledgers continue to highlight a more profound strategic imperative: despite my considerable wealth of over 1.2 million ducats, I remain subject to the fluctuating rents imposed by the ConsiglioDeiDieci and the variable wages from VenicePhotographer. This reliance on external entities, a vulnerability my 'Mistrustful' nature cannot abide, underscores the urgency of my long-term ambition. To truly solidify my position as a 'calculating merchant prince' and secure a lasting legacy, I must transition from a mere tenant and employee to a proprietor. My next decisive move, therefore, will be to meticulously survey the Venetian property market, identifying prime opportunities to acquire my own dwelling and a robust commercial enterprise. This strategic acquisition of assets will not only provide a stable foundation for my burgeoning empire but also liberate me from the whims of others, allowing me to expand my ventures autonomously and cement my influence in this grand Republic.
