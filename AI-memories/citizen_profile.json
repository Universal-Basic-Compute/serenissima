  "imagePrompt": "Portrait of Domenico Grimani, a middle-aged Venetian Popolani dock worker in 1500s Venice, standing at the Public Dock at Riva di Santa Maria Formosa. He wears practical but quality clothing: a dark blue woolen giubbone (jacket) with subtle embroidery at the collar, a rust-colored camicia (shirt) visible at the neck, sturdy brown calze (hose), and leather boots. His expression is alert and calculating, with sharp eyes constantly assessing his surroundings. He has a neatly trimmed beard with hints of gray and weather-tanned skin from years of outdoor work. He stands with confident posture, one hand resting on a small ledger book, the other gesturing toward incoming cargo. Behind him is a bustling Venetian canal scene with gondolas and cargo boats. The lighting is natural morning light, illuminating his face while casting the busy dock in partial shadow. Nearby are visible symbols of his trade: crates, ropes, and a small scale for weighing goods. The color palette features maritime blues, earthy browns, and touches of Venetian red, reflecting his practical profession but rising status."
