His intelligent brown eyes show both shrewdness and wariness, with slight wrinkles from years of calculating profits and assessing deals. He has a well-groomed beard and weathered hands that speak of honest work. The setting is a Venetian market stall with scales, ledgers, and merchant goods visible in the background. Natural daylight illuminates the scene, casting realistic shadows. The color palette features rich blues, warm golds, and earth tones appropriate for his social standing. His expression conveys competence and caution, with a slight smile that suggests he knows more than he reveals."
