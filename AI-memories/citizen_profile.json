  "description": "Caterina Baffo, a stocky woman in her mid-40s with calloused hands and observant hazel eyes, has risen from humble beginnings to become a respected figure among the Facchini. Born to a family of dockworkers, she leveraged her natural aptitude for numbers and organization to secure a position at the customs house, where she meticulously tracks the flow of goods through Venice's bustling port. Her recent investment in a small warehouse reflects her pragmatic approach to building wealth—focusing on essential infrastructure rather than luxuries. Despite her growing prosperity, Caterina maintains the modest attire of her class, though the quality of her wool garments has noticeably improved. She rises before dawn each day to inspect her warehouse before her shift, carefully noting each crate and barrel that passes through the customs house, and often spends evenings studying merchant ledgers to better understand trade patterns. Though reserved with strangers, she's developed a reputation for fairness among fellow workers and unexpected generosity toward struggling families in her parish. Her greatest pride remains her three children, whom she is determined will receive the education she never had.",

The shield features a silver key crossed with a golden quill, representing Caterina's position at the customs house and her meticulous record-keeping. In the center, a small white warehouse symbolizes her first significant property investment. The entire design is bordered by a rope knot pattern, honoring the family's dockworker heritage.",
