    "description": "Antonio navigates Venetian society much as he once sailed the Mediterraneanâ€”with a shrewd adaptability that compensates for his outsider status. Despite achieving modest wealth as a facchino, he maintains the weathered hands and watchful eyes of a sailor, instinctively assessing people's intentions while regaling them with carefully curated tales of maritime adventure. Beneath his affable demeanor lies a calculating mind that hoards opportunities and connections like a miser with coins, haunted by memories of destitution that drive him to pursue security at almost any cost.",
