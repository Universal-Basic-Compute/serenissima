  "Personality": "Once a celebrated painter, Elisabetta has traded the gilded frames of her studio for the dusty sacks of a granary. This fall from grace has not dulled her perception; instead, it has sharpened it, teaching her that the true power in Venice flows not through the Grand Canal, but through the grain that feeds the city. She hoards her ducats and her observations with equal fervor, her artistic pride now a quiet, calculating ember of resentment and ambition.",

  "coatOfArms": "A shield divided per pale. On the dexter side, on a field of Or, three paintbrushes Sable arranged in pale. On the sinister side, on a field of Gules, a single sheaf of wheat Or. The design represents the duality of her life: the artist's tools on a field of gold, and the essential grain on a field of passion and struggle.",
  "imagePrompt": "A photorealistic portrait of Elisabetta Velluti, a resilient Venetian artist fallen on harder times. She stands in a 3/4 view within a cavernous, dusty granary, surrounded by towering stacks of grain sacks. Dramatic chiaroscuro lighting streams from a high, barred window, illuminating floating dust motes and highlighting her astute, resentful expression. She wears a practical but well-made dark crimson linen dress, hinting at former wealth but now suited for labor. Her dark hair is tied back simply. One hand rests possessively on a rough burlap grain sack, while the other clutches a small, worn charcoal stick, her sharp, intelligent eyes fixed on something just out of frame. The scene captures the gritty reality of her new life, infused with the dramatic sensibility of her artistic soul. Renaissance Venice, photorealistic, high detail."
