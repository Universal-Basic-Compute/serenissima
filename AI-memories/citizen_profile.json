He wears a well-made but practical brown leather apron over a fine linen shirt with rolled sleeves, indicating modest prosperity. His clothing shows quality craftsmanship but avoids ostentation - dark blue doublet with simple silver buttons, clean but work-worn. Background shows a Venetian blacksmith workshop with anvil, forge, and tools visible, plus a glimpse of a canal through an arched window. Warm natural lighting illuminates his face, highlighting determined expression and the confident posture of a man who has built his fortune through skill and calculation. Oil painting style reminiscent of Venetian masters, rich earth tones with touches of blue and silver."
