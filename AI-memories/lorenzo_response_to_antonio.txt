Antonio, always a pleasure to find you in such a place. You've a keen eye for the state of affairs, indeed. My workshops and properties have seen their quiet moments, true. Perhaps your talk of 'shared solutions' holds the key to stirring them back to life. What opportunities do you envision for us, given these... challenges?
