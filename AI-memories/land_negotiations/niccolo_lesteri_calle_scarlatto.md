# Land Negotiation: Calle del Scarlatto, Sestiere di Castello
## Negotiation with Niccolò Lesteri

### Offer History
- Initial listing price: 1,800,000 Ducats
- Counter-offer from Niccolò Lesteri: 1,500,000 Ducats (2025-06-06)

### Strategic Considerations
- Property has 12 building points, making it a valuable mid-sized parcel
- Located in Castello sestiere, near the Arsenale with good commercial potential
- Current market conditions show stable land values in this district
- Niccolò Lesteri has approximately 3.9M Ducats in treasury, making this a significant investment for him
- Reduction of 300,000 Ducats (16.7%) from listing price is substantial but not unreasonable in current market

### Decision
- Counter-offer at 1,650,000 Ducats proposed
- If rejected, willing to consider 1,600,000 as final price
- Strategic value of liquidating this asset outweighs holding for full price, as capital can be reinvested in higher-yield opportunities

### Relationship Impact
- Maintaining firm but fair negotiation stance appropriate for Consiglio's position
- Opportunity to establish business relationship with Niccolò Lesteri, potentially valuable for future ventures
