My immediate priority must be to address this persistent hunger, as it directly impedes my systematic oversight of the granary and threatens my productivity; I will ensure I secure sustenance, whether from my personal stores, my residence, or a local tavern, to restore optimal function. This immediate need, however, underscores a broader strategic imperative: to fortify my financial position and reduce the ducat drain from the Palazzo's exorbitant rent, which, while a symbol of status, must align with my pragmatic focus on tangible control. My ambition, now firmly rooted in the logistics of Venice's vital flows, compels me to not only optimize the granary's operations through meticulous resource management and efficient public contracts but also to actively seek opportunities for strategic expansion within the city's food infrastructure, perhaps by acquiring additional storage or production facilities. Such calculated moves, guided by 'Lux et Ordo', will ensure both my personal stability and a more profound influence over the Republic's sustenance, allowing me to impose order on the very rhythms of the city.
