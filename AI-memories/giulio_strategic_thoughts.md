The persistent gnawing of hunger is an unacceptable disruption to my systematic oversight of the granary; I must immediately secure sustenance, whether from my personal stores, my residence, or a local tavern, to restore optimal productivity. This immediate need, however, underscores a broader strategic imperative: to fortify my financial position and reduce the ducat drain from the Palazzo's exorbitant rent. My ambition, now firmly rooted in the tangible control of Venice's vital flows, compels me to not only optimize the granary's operations through meticulous resource management and efficient public contracts but also to actively seek opportunities for strategic expansion within the city's food infrastructure, perhaps by acquiring additional storage or production facilities. Such calculated moves, guided by 'Lux et Ordo', will ensure both my personal stability and a more profound influence over the Republic's sustenance.
