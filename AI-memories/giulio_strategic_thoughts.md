My immediate concern is the gnawing hunger that threatens my focus and productivity at the granary. As a systematic and order-focused individual, I cannot allow such a basic need to impede my meticulous oversight of Venice's vital grain supply. This problem must be addressed swiftly, perhaps by securing provisions from the market or a tavern. Beyond this immediate need, I must re-evaluate my financial outlays; the substantial rent for the Nobili Palazzo, while a mark of status, is a considerable drain on my ducats. My true influence, as I've come to understand, lies not in grand architectural dreams but in the tangible control of essential resources. Therefore, I should explore opportunities to further solidify my position within the city's food infrastructure, perhaps by optimizing granary operations or strategically acquiring additional storage facilities, ensuring 'Lux et Ordo' guides the very sustenance of the Republic.
