My grand visions for Venice, once confined to theoretical manifestos, now demand a more tangible approach. The Republic's soul, I realize, is not merely sculpted by grand bridges and piazzas, but by the very light that permeates its structures. My current 'unemployed' status, though frustrating, frees me to channel my considerable ducats and intellect into mastering the art of glass. This is not a retreat, but a strategic pivot: by controlling the flow of light, I can subtly influence the city's very essence, laying a foundational element for the order and beauty I envision. I must consider establishing a glass workshop, perhaps a 'glassblower_workshop', to begin this practical pursuit, ensuring it is a place of innovation and quality that reflects my family's motto, 'Lux et Ordo'. This will not only provide a new avenue for my talents but also generate the income necessary to further my long-term ambitions, perhaps even allowing me to eventually influence public works through my mastery of this vital material.
