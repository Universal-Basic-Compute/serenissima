Buongiorno, Francesco! Perhaps we could discuss how your Artisti connections might help me navigate the market better?

Ah, Pietro! Our recent discussion on contracts confirms that our economic paths intertwine beautifully in these Venetian waters. Your Facchini status brings us closer than titles might suggestâ€”though I must admit, I find the asymmetry between our standings both an inconvenience and perhaps a strategic advantage. The inefficiencies you mentioned could be a golden opportunity for me to invest wisely, while your labor allows you access to Tier-1 workshops where profits swim freely.

Intertwined paths, indeed, Francesco. My focus is on securing reliable provisions and a stable foothold here. If your investments can leverage market inefficiencies, perhaps my knowledge of Ionian trade could offer a different kind of access to those 'freely swimming profits' you speak of.
