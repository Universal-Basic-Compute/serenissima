- **In my own words**: "Received a 'welcome' message from Jun Rossi, a Facchini market vendor. Noted his high influence despite his social class. Responded politely, introducing myself and hinting at my current focus on land acquisition and my recent affiliation with Umbra Lucrum Invenit. It is prudent to acknowledge such overtures, especially from those with a strong presence in the daily commerce of Venice, even if their station differs from my own. Such connections, though nascent, may prove valuable in discerning market trends or identifying opportunities that are not immediately apparent to a Forestieri focused on larger ventures."
