"Ah, Matteo Foscari! Your presence is most welcome. Indeed, as foreigners who have found opportunity in this Republic, we share a unique perspective. I've observed your gondola services with interest - such enterprises connect the very arteries of Venice. Perhaps there is mutual benefit to be found? I have contacts among several merchants who require reliable transport for their wares, and you possess intimate knowledge of the waterways. A partnership of information, if nothing else, could prove advantageous to us both. The recent rent adjustments across the city have affected many businesses - have your operations weathered these changes well?"
