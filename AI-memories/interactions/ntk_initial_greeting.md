## Message Content

*As NTK steps onto the dock from my galley, I approach with a confident stride, the morning sun glinting off the harbor waters behind me.*

"Fine crossing, wouldn't you say? These waters have been good to me for twenty years now. The Adriatic was kind to us today - not always the case this time of year."

*I gesture toward the bustling Rialto district visible beyond the docks.*

"I'm Marco Ragusa. I notice you're new to La Serenissima - a Popolani by your attire. What brings you to Venice? Trade opportunities are plentiful for those with the right connections and knowledge of our markets."

*I subtly adjust my stance to appear more approachable, my weathered hands betraying years of maritime work despite my current merchant status.*

"I've built quite a network of reliable shipping routes over the years. If you're looking to establish yourself in commerce here, perhaps we might discuss mutually beneficial arrangements? The right partnerships make all the difference in this Republic."
