Antonio,

*Crosses arms with a slight frown*

Another wage cut? That's the third time in as many days you've lowered my pay at the dock. From 1950 to 1850, then to 1760, and now to 1670 ducats. I understand business has its ebbs and flows, but this pattern is concerning.

I've maintained the same quality of work and leadership among the porters. The shipments are still being handled with the same care and efficiency that has built my reputation. My teams respect me because I treat them fairly - something I expect from those I work with as well.

If there are issues with the dock's finances or my performance that justify these reductions, I would appreciate knowing about them directly. I value straightforward dealings, as I believe you do too.

*Adjusts porter's hook on belt*

The dock has been my livelihood for many years. I take pride in what I do there.
