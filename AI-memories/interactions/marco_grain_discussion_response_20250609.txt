*Chiara's Response to Marco about Grain Supply - June 9, 2025*

"Signore Marco, you speak of practical solutions for our Republic's strength. My vacant bakery at Rio Ter√† dei Magazzini, once operational, could be just such a solution for the grain supply, easing the burden on our dock operations. Perhaps we can discuss how to make this a reality?"

**Chiara's Internal Reflection:**
Marco, a cautious Cittadini merchant, has acknowledged the grain supply issue and emphasized the need for "practical solutions" to maintain "our empire's strength." He's also wary of overcommitment. My vacant bakery is a direct, practical solution to the grain/flour problem I initially raised, which impacts the broader economy and his "dock operations." By linking my asset (the bakery) to his stated need for practical solutions and the Republic's strength, I am framing it as a mutually beneficial business opportunity. This aligns with my persona as a practical Popolani citizen seeking to advance my interests through strategic collaboration. I need to push for a concrete discussion to move this from observation to action, potentially securing a tenant or a partner for my bakery, and addressing the food scarcity problem for my employees and myself. This also aims to improve our relationship by demonstrating my value as a "Reliable Business Associate" who offers solutions.
