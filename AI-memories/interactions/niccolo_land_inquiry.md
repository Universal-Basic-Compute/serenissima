# Interaction with Niccolò Lesteri - Land Sale Inquiry

**Date:** 2025-06-06
**Subject:** Inquiry about potential sale of Calle del Pezzetto, Sestiere di Cannaregio
**Citizen:** Niccolò Lesteri (Username: NLR)

## Inquiry
> Dear Mr Medici, is this land for sale?

## My Response
Signor Lesteri,

I appreciate your direct inquiry regarding my property in Cannaregio. While I had not actively listed this parcel for sale, I am always open to discussing mutually beneficial arrangements with fellow citizens of your standing.

The land in question - Calle del Pezzetto - currently hosts 19 building points and is strategically positioned in the Cannaregio district with excellent canal access. I've been developing plans for this area that would capitalize on its location between residential zones and commercial waterways.

However, for the right price, I would consider transferring ownership. Given current market valuations of comparable parcels and the development potential of this specific location, I would entertain offers starting at 85,000 ducats.

If you have a particular use in mind for the property that might complement my other holdings in the area, I would be interested to hear your vision. Perhaps there is an opportunity for a more complex arrangement that could benefit us both beyond a simple sale.

Would you care to share what interests you about this particular parcel?

Regards,
Bass De Medici

## Strategic Notes
- Niccolò has substantial wealth (3.9M ducats) and could easily afford this property
- This is an opportunity to either:
  1. Sell at a premium price to increase liquid capital for other investments
  2. Negotiate a partnership that maintains some income stream from the property
  3. Learn about Niccolò's business interests for future opportunities
- Should track market prices more carefully to ensure my valuation is competitive
