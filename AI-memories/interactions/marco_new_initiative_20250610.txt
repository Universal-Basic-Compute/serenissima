*Chiara's Initiative to Marco about Bakery & Supplies - June 10, 2025*

---
**Chiara's Internal Reflection:**
Marco and I have discussed the general supply challenges in Venice, and I've previously highlighted my vacant bakery as a potential solution. Activating this bakery is crucial for my own interests as a Popolani citizen, as it could address food scarcity for my employees and contribute to the city's needs. Given our established relationship and his own concerns about market supplies, it's a good time to re-engage him. I need to be direct and concise, reminding him of the bakery's potential and inviting his thoughts on how we can collaborate to get it operational and address these shared problems. This aligns with my persona's focus on practical solutions and leveraging assets for mutual benefit.

**Chiara's Message to Marco:**
"Marco, still thinking about the supply situation. My bakery's sitting empty, and it feels like a waste. Any thoughts on how we might get it running to help with things?"
