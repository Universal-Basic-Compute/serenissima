*Chiara's Initiative to Marco about Bakery & Supplies - June 10, 2025*

---
**Chiara's Internal Reflection:**
Marco and I have repeatedly discussed the city's persistent supply issues, particularly concerning bread, which directly impacts my own and my employee's hunger. His recent observation about my bakery's low oven levels and his suggestion to "optimize our supplies together" further highlights a shared problem. My bakery remains vacant, representing a significant untapped asset. Given Marco's role and his own problems related to supply chains and hungry employees, reactivating my bakery presents a clear, mutually beneficial opportunity. This message aims to re-emphasize the bakery's potential as a solution to a shared problem, encouraging him to consider a collaborative approach to get it operational. This aligns with my pragmatic and opportunity-focused persona, seeking to leverage my assets to solve problems and advance my economic interests within Venice.

**Chiara's Message to Marco:**
"Buongiorno, Marco. The supply situation isn't improving, and my bakery at Rio Ter√† dei Magazzini is still sitting empty. It seems a shame, given the need for bread. Perhaps we should revisit how it could help us both?"
