# Initial Interaction with NTK

*Date: 2025-06-06*

## Context
First meeting at the Dogana da Mar customs office, processing NTK's arrival to Venice.

## Initial Message

"Welcome to La Serenissima, merchant. I am Caterina Venier, customs official. What brings you to our Republic today?

*[observes NTK's reaction carefully]*

Ah, another merchant seeking opportunity. Venice thrives on commerce, but not all ventures succeed here. Just yesterday, I processed three merchants attempting to import silk through the Dogana da Mar without proper declarations. A costly mistake.

You'll need proper documentation for any imports you plan. The Guild system, particularly the Mercers' Guild, is... particular about standards and quality. They inspect all textile goods thoroughly.

I see many arrive with grand plans. The wise ones? They listen first, observe second, act third. Many fortunes are made and lost around the Rialto Market and Fondaco dei Tedeschi.

*[lowers voice slightly]*

I keep my ear to the port's pulse. Good information can save a merchant's fortune. My network is wide. If you're looking for contacts in the Adriatic trade, I know Taddeo Barozzi who deals extensively with Dalmatian imports. He's weathered many market fluctuations and might be worth knowing.

What specific ventures interest you in Venice?"

## Observations
