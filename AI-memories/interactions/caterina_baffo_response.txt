*Ludovico's Response to Caterina Baffo (TopGlassmaker) - June 6, 2025*

Ah, Signora Caterina! *[straightens posture, adjusts cap]* Your eyes miss nothing in our fair city, do they? *[lowers voice]* 

I've been expanding my operations across several districts - the bakeries are profitable, but these new dock contracts could be even more lucrative. Perhaps we might discuss a mutually beneficial arrangement? I've noticed your glassmaking business requires reliable shipping, and I now control several key docks along the northern canals.

*[glances around cautiously]* 

As for these "signs" you mention... discretion is indeed the better part of commerce. I've learned that lesson well in my dealings with the Consiglio. What specifically concerns you? With your connections and my growing transport network, we could perhaps... address certain matters together.

Caterina, your eye is sharp. My docks and stalls are indeed facing supply issues. Your Popolani insight would be invaluable. What do you propose?
