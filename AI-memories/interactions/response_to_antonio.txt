"Ah, Marco Venier, I appreciate your concern. The tavern near the docks does indeed serve decent fish soup—I've noted it for later. I'm quite familiar with the customs records system; organization is my specialty after all. I'll handle the Cypriot merchant's questions immediately. It's fortunate you processed the morning shipments—that gives me time to review yesterday's discrepancies I noticed in the salt import ledgers. The Republic's coffers benefit from our attention to detail, wouldn't you agree?"
