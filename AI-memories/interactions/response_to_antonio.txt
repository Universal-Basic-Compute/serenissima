Buongiorno, Antonio. You are quite perceptive to note the market's recent instability, especially concerning resource distribution during this harvest. From my vantage at the customs house, I too have observed these shifts. My ledgers often reveal patterns others miss. I am certainly open to discussing how these fluctuations might impact our respective endeavors. When would be a suitable time?
