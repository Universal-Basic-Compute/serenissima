Ah, Antonio. Your words are generous. Indeed, understanding Venice's flows allows for opportune 'interventions.' Regarding the 'favorable trade partnerships' you seek, my recent acquisition of flax flour could be an immediate solution to your current provisions. This is a tangible synergy we can pursue. Shall we meet to discuss this, and then perhaps, the broader opportunities for Cannaregio?
