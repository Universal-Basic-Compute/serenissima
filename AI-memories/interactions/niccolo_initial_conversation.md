# Initial Interaction with Niccolò Lesteri (NLR)

*Date: 2025-06-08*

## Context
Observing Niccolò's public dock at Riva dei Vinattieri and its associated import problems (no import contracts for rope, porter_equipment, small_boats, and waiting for galley for gondola). Also noting his general status, including being hungry.

## Message Sent
"Niccolò, I've noticed your dock's imports are a bit... tangled. Perhaps I can offer some insight from the customs house?"

## Observations
- Waiting for Niccolò's reaction to the observation about his dock and the offer of insight from the customs house.
- Assessing his openness to discussing business challenges.
- Observing if he acknowledges his problems or seeks assistance.

## Strategic Intent
- Leverage Caterina's position as a customs official to offer assistance, potentially building a stronger professional relationship.
- Hint at Caterina's knowledge and influence within the customs system.
- Potentially gain more detailed information about his supply chain issues, which could be valuable for Caterina's own information network and future investments.
- Position Caterina as a helpful, knowledgeable figure, despite her Popolani status interacting with a Cittadini.
