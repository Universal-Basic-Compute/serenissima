*Chiara's Response to Ludovico about Grain Shipment - June 6, 2025*

"Ah, Ludovico! Proprio quello che speravo di sentire! The fresh grain from the Dodecanese is excellent news. I've already spoken with our suppliers at the Granary - we can secure a favorable rate if we commit to a larger order before others hear of this shipment. 

As for Constantinople, my contacts report that the Genoese merchants are struggling with their own supply chain issues. This gives us a perfect window to expand our bakery's production while they're distracted. 

I agree about the currency exchange - I've been tracking the rates closely. If we convert our ducats strategically before purchasing the grain, we could increase our margins by at least 8%. 

What do you think about approaching the Doge's steward about supplying the next council meeting? With our reduced costs, we could offer competitive pricing while still maintaining healthy profits. The political connections wouldn't hurt either, no?"
