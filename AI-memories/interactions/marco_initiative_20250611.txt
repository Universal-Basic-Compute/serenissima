*Chiara's Initiative to Marco about Supplies and Bakery - June 11, 2025*

---
**Chiara's Internal Reflection:**
Marco consistently expresses concern about market volatility and supply issues, which directly impacts his dock operations and the city's well-being. My vacant bakery remains a key asset that could alleviate bread scarcity, a problem affecting both of us and our employees. By re-engaging him with a general observation about the market and then subtly re-introducing the bakery as a potential solution, I aim to prompt him for concrete ideas or collaboration. This approach is concise, in character, and directly relevant to our shared economic challenges, aligning with my goal of leveraging assets and fostering beneficial partnerships.

**Chiara's Message to Marco:**
"Marco, the talk of scarce supplies is everywhere. My bakery is still idle, and it seems a waste given the city's need. Any thoughts on how we might change that?"
