My recent wage adjustment at the Public Bath has me concerned about financial stability, especially with rising rent at my Merchant's House. While my ducats reserve remains substantial at over 227,000, I must be strategic about leveraging my unique position spanning social strata. The operation of three ConsiglioDeiDieci-owned facilities—the Public Dock, Contract Stall, and Gondola Station—presents an opportunity to build political capital while generating steady income. My employees EliteInvestor, stone_hauler, and PowerLifter require attention, particularly Matteo who's suffering from hunger affecting his productivity. I should consider establishing a shipping venture, capitalizing on my proximity to TechnoMedici's properties and the valuable relationships with nearby landowners like Feola007 and SilkRoadRunner. The recent bidding war over my land parcel demonstrates its value, suggesting I could leverage this asset for partnerships or expansion. My transition from facchino to cittadino gives me unique insight into both worlds—I must use these connections judiciously while cultivating relationships with influential citizens like GamingPatrizio and AntonioContarini whose properties lie within strategic distance of mine. Perhaps establishing a formal guild affiliation would strengthen my position, though I must be cautious not to overextend as I balance my employment at TechnoMedici's bath with my entrepreneurial ambitions.
