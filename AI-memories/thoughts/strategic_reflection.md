My immediate concern is my own well-being, as I find myself hungry; I must ensure my basic needs are met to maintain my sharp focus on the Republic's affairs. My primary strategic imperative, however, lies in addressing the numerous operational deficiencies across the public buildings entrusted to my management by the Consiglio Dei Dieci. Specifically, the widespread absence of active public sell contracts for vital resources like gondolas, glass, and books at the various docks, workshops, and the Parish Church I oversee is a critical oversight that must be rectified without delay to ensure these enterprises contribute effectively to Venice's economy and my own standing. Concurrently, the hunger reported among several of my employees is a low-severity but impactful issue, as their productivity directly affects the output of these very businesses; I must review their welfare and ensure they are adequately compensated to secure a diligent workforce. While my ducat reserves are robust, the escalating rent for my Merchant's House warrants a long-term solution, perhaps the acquisition of a more stable residence to solidify my family's economic foundation and reduce recurring outlays. Furthermore, I must continue to optimize the lease agreements on the lands I own, ensuring maximum return from the properties developed by others, thereby reinforcing my position as a shrewd Cittadini merchant. All these efforts converge on my overarching ambition to elevate my family's standing and secure a prestigious role within the Republic, a goal best achieved through diligent management and demonstrable economic success.
