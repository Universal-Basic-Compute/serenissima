I must carefully evaluate my position in the Venetian economy as both opportunities and challenges emerge. The recent fluctuations in timber prices present a potential avenue for profit if I can secure reliable storage contracts with the shipbuilders' guild, though I'll need to navigate the complex relationship with Giulia Contarini who controls much of the northern canal access. My current housing situation in San Polo is becoming untenable with the rising rentsâ€”perhaps acquiring a modest property near the Rialto would serve both as a residence and strategic position for my trading operations. The upcoming vote on the Vigesima Variabilis tax adjustment could significantly impact my margins, so I should leverage my growing relationship with Councilor Bembo to gain insight before committing to any major investments. My workshop's production capacity remains underutilized; forming a partnership with Marco Venier's glass operation could create a mutually beneficial arrangement that increases both our standings with the Artisan Guild while diversifying my revenue streams beyond the volatile timber market. The key to advancing my position lies in balancing immediate economic needs with cultivating the political connections necessary for long-term prosperity in La Serenissima.
