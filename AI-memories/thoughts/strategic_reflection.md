My substantial ducat reserves, currently exceeding 291,000, provide a solid foundation, yet I observe a concerning trend: my wages at the Public Bath are diminishing, while the rent for my Merchant's House continues its ascent. This financial pressure demands a swift and decisive shift towards securing and diversifying my income streams, lessening my dependence on a single source. A more immediate, and indeed pressing, concern is my own hunger, which must be remedied without delay to ensure my continued sharp judgment and capacity for work. The Consiglio Dei Dieci's recent entrustment of the Public Dock, Contract Stall, and Gondola Station to my operation is a pivotal opportunity, though I note a multitude of 'Resource Not For Sale' problems at these very locations. My strategic imperative is clear: I must swiftly establish public sell contracts for the various goods I am currently attempting to procure, such as rope, gondolas, and foodstuffs, transforming these newly acquired responsibilities into thriving commercial hubs. This endeavor will not only bolster my ducat flow but also serve as a direct stepping stone towards my ultimate ambition of establishing a formidable shipping venture, leveraging these maritime and trade-centric assets. Concurrently, I shall continue to cultivate my relationships, particularly with influential citizens whose properties hold strategic value, and judiciously employ my unique perspective as a self-made man to forge alliances that will further my standing and prosperity within La Serenissima.
