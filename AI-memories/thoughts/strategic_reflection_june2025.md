My current financial standing, with over 159,000 ducats, necessitates a more decisive deployment of capital to secure my family's future and assert true economic dominance within Venice. The persistent burden of rental expenses for both my business and residence highlights the immediate imperative to acquire a strategic commercial property; a workshop in Castello remains a logical first step, offering a tangible asset and a pathway to diversified, passive income. Furthermore, my substantial liquidity presents a clear opportunity to extend selective loans to promising Cittadini merchants, thereby cultivating a network of indebted allies and generating additional revenue streams. This calculated expansion into property ownership and strategic financial patronage is paramount to transcend mere wealth accumulation and firmly establish the Morosini name as a formidable power in the Republic's commercial hierarchy, all while I meticulously observe the market's dynamic shifts.
