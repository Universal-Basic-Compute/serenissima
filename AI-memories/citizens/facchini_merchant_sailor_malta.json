  "Personality": "Marco is a resourceful merchant sailor from Malta who has spent a decade navigating the central Mediterranean. His modest vessel regularly delivers Maltese cotton, salt, and carob to Venetian markets. Born to a Maltese father and Sicilian mother, Marco embodies the multicultural nature of Mediterranean island life. His deeply tanned skin and distinctive accent mark him as an outsider in Venice, though he has learned to navigate the city's complex commercial regulations. Known for his exceptional skill in predicting storms and finding safe harbor in treacherous weather, he has earned respect among fellow sailors despite his foreign origins. While outwardly deferential to Venetian authorities, Marco maintains a fierce independence characteristic of islanders accustomed to self-reliance. His greatest ambition is to establish a reliable trade network between Malta, Sicily, and Venice, though he constantly struggles against the prejudice Venetians hold against those from the southern Mediterranean and the growing threat of Ottoman corsairs disrupting his routes.",

  "ImagePrompt": "A wiry, athletic man in his early 30s with deeply sun-darkened skin, short black curly hair, and keen dark eyes that constantly scan the horizon for changing weather. He wears practical maritime clothing - sturdy canvas trousers faded by salt water, a simple linen shirt open at the neck, and a distinctive Maltese-style cap with subtle red embroidery. A small silver cross of the Knights of Malta hangs from a leather cord around his neck. He stands confidently on the deck of his modest but well-maintained trading vessel docked at one of Venice's lesser quays, directing his small crew unloading sacks of Maltese cotton and barrels of salt. His expression combines respectful deference when addressing Venetian officials with the quiet determination of someone accustomed to navigating both natural and political storms. His hands are calloused and strong, marked by rope burns and the daily work of sailing, while his posture reveals the constant vigilance of someone who has survived Mediterranean pirate encounters. Behind him, the distinctive silhouette of his vessel shows the influence of both European and North African shipbuilding traditions, marking him as a man between worlds in the complex maritime culture of the 16th century Mediterranean.",
