  "Personality": "Stefano is a seasoned merchant sailor from Split who has spent two decades navigating the Adriatic trade routes. His vessel regularly delivers Dalmatian timber, salt, and olive oil to Venice's bustling ports. Though Croatian by birth, Stefano has developed a deep understanding of Venetian commercial customs and speaks the local dialect with surprising fluency. Known for his exceptional skill in predicting weather patterns, he has earned respect for safely delivering cargo through notorious winter storms. While outwardly jovial and quick to share tales from distant ports, Stefano maintains a calculating business mind and meticulously tracks debts owed to him. His greatest ambition is to establish a small fleet of trading vessels operated by his three sons, creating a family enterprise that could eventually rival smaller Venetian shipping houses.",

  "ImagePrompt": "A broad-shouldered man in his mid-40s with leathery sun-weathered skin, a thick salt-and-pepper beard, and deep laugh lines around his eyes that contrast with his watchful gaze. He wears practical maritime clothing - loose-fitting linen trousers, a faded blue woolen shirt with sleeves rolled to reveal muscular forearms, and a distinctive Dalmatian-style red cap. A well-worn leather belt holds various small tools and a sheathed knife. He stands confidently on the deck of his modest but well-maintained trading vessel docked at Venice's Riva degli Schiavoni, one hand resting on the tiller while the other gestures expressively as he directs his small crew unloading cargo. Behind him, crates of Dalmatian goods await inspection by Venetian customs officials. The morning light catches the silver in his beard and the glint of a small silver St. Nicholas medallion at his neck as he surveys the bustling Venetian waterfront with the practiced eye of someone who knows its rhythms but remains slightly apart from them.",
