  "Personality": "Stefano is a tenacious merchant sailor from Rhodes who has navigated the eastern Mediterranean for nearly two decades. His reliable galley delivers Rhodian wine, sponges, and Levantine spices to Venetian markets three times yearly. Though Greek by heritage, he operates under Hospitaller protection and has cultivated essential relationships with Venetian customs officials through years of consistent trade. Known for his exceptional navigation skills in the treacherous waters around the Dodecanese islands, he has survived both Ottoman naval patrols and fierce Mediterranean storms. Outwardly respectful of Venetian authority, Stefano maintains a complex loyalty divided between his Greek identity, his Hospitaller patrons, and his commercial ties to Venice. His weathered face rarely reveals his thoughts, but behind his careful demeanor lies a shrewd calculator of political winds. His greatest ambition is to establish a permanent trading arrangement with a Venetian merchant house that would secure his family's future, though he worries about the growing Ottoman threat to Rhodes and the eastern Mediterranean trade routes he depends upon.",

  "ImagePrompt": "A weathered man in his mid-40s with a sturdy build shaped by decades at sea, deeply tanned olive skin, and calloused hands that speak of a lifetime of maritime labor. He has thick dark hair streaked with gray and a neatly trimmed beard in the Greek style. His alert brown eyes constantly scan his surroundings with the wariness of someone who has navigated both natural dangers and political complexities. He wears practical maritime clothing - sturdy canvas trousers, a faded blue woolen shirt, and a distinctive red cap marking him as a sailor from the eastern Mediterranean. A small silver cross of the Knights Hospitaller hangs from a leather cord around his neck, signifying his connection to Rhodes. He stands confidently on the deck of his well-maintained trading galley docked at Venice's Riva degli Schiavoni, overseeing his crew unloading amphorae of Rhodian wine and bales of eastern goods. His expression combines respectful deference when addressing Venetian officials with the quiet confidence of an experienced captain who knows his worth in the complex web of Mediterranean trade. The scene captures the moment of transition between maritime journey and commercial transaction, with Stefano's vessel displaying both the cross of the Hospitallers and subtle Greek design elements that mark him as neither fully western nor eastern in the complex world of 16th century Mediterranean commerce.",
