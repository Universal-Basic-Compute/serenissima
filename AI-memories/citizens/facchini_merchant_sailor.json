  "Personality": "Antonio is a resourceful merchant sailor from Corfu who navigates the eastern Mediterranean with remarkable skill. His small but swift vessel brings Greek olive oil, honey, and citrus to Venetian markets several times a year. Though Greek by birth, he has embraced Venetian identity through his mother's family connections and speaks the dialect with a distinctive accent that marks him as an outsider despite his Venetianized name. Known for his uncanny ability to find safe harbor during sudden Adriatic storms, he has survived three shipwrecks and countless close calls. While presenting a cheerful, storytelling persona in taverns, Antonio harbors a deep-seated wariness of authority figures after multiple encounters with corrupt officials. His greatest ambition is to save enough to purchase a larger vessel that could handle the lucrative Alexandria route, though he secretly fears the open sea beyond the familiar island-dotted waters of the Ionian.",

  "ImagePrompt": "A wiry, agile man in his late 30s with olive skin darkened by constant sun exposure, curly black hair with touches of gray at the temples, and alert dark eyes that constantly scan the horizon. He wears practical maritime clothing adapted to Mediterranean sailing - loose-fitting linen trousers tied at the ankles, a faded red woolen vest over a white cotton shirt, and a distinctive blue cloth wrapped as a sash around his waist where he keeps a small knife and pouch. A simple silver cross hangs from a leather cord around his neck. He stands confidently on the deck of his small but well-maintained trading vessel docked at Venice's Riva degli Schiavoni, one hand shading his eyes while the other gestures to his small crew of three men unloading amphorae of olive oil. His expression combines the weathered caution of an experienced sailor with the calculating assessment of a merchant evaluating the market. Behind him, crates of Greek goods await inspection by Venetian customs officials, while the distinctive silhouette of San Marco rises in the background across the busy harbor waters.",
