  "Personality": "Matteo is a tenacious merchant sailor from Pisa who has spent twelve years navigating the Tyrrhenian Sea and western Mediterranean. His modest but reliable vessel delivers Tuscan wool, marble, and agricultural products to Venetian markets twice yearly. Though Pisan by birth—and thus operating in the shadow of Florence's dominance over his homeland—Matteo has developed practical working relationships with Venetian merchants and customs officials. Known for his exceptional endurance during long coastal voyages and his ability to secure favorable terms through persistent negotiation, he commands respect for his reliability if not his modest origins. Outwardly deferential to Venetian authorities, Matteo harbors a quiet pride in Pisa's maritime heritage that predates Venice's own rise. His greatest ambition is to expand his trading network to include the North African coast, though he worries about increasing pirate activity and the complicated politics between Italian maritime powers and the Ottoman Empire. Despite his weathered appearance and calloused hands, Matteo possesses a surprising knowledge of classical literature, often quoting Virgil when explaining the sea's dangers to his young crew members.",

  "ImagePrompt": "A lean, sinewy man in his early 40s with sun-darkened skin, a short-cropped brown beard with flecks of gray, and thoughtful hazel eyes that reveal both practical wisdom and unexpected education. He wears functional maritime clothing - sturdy brown wool trousers, a faded blue linen shirt patched in several places, and a distinctive Pisan-style cap that has seen better days. A merchant's leather pouch hangs securely from his well-worn belt alongside a practical sailor's knife. He stands with quiet dignity on the deck of his modest but meticulously maintained trading vessel docked at Venice's Riva degli Schiavoni, directing his small crew unloading crates of Tuscan goods. His hands are heavily calloused from years of handling ropes and cargo, but he holds a small, well-preserved copy of Virgil's works that he consults during quiet moments. His expression combines respectful deference when addressing Venetian officials with flashes of scholarly insight when discussing trade routes or classical navigation techniques. Behind him, his vessel displays subtle Pisan design elements that mark his heritage, while the bustling Venetian harbor stretches into the distance.",
