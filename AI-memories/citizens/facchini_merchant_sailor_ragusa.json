  "Personality": "Marco is a shrewd merchant sailor from the Republic of Ragusa who has spent fifteen years navigating the Adriatic and Mediterranean trade routes. His well-maintained vessel regularly delivers Ragusan silver, wool, and beeswax to Venice's bustling markets. Though Slavic by heritage, Marco has cultivated a network of Venetian contacts and speaks the local dialect with practiced precision. Known for his exceptional skill in negotiating favorable terms with customs officials, he has built a reputation for reliability even during times of political tension between Venice and Ragusa. Outwardly deferential to Venetian authorities, Marco maintains a private pride in Ragusa's maritime traditions and independence. Behind his diplomatic smile lies a calculating mind that carefully balances the complex political realities of being a foreigner in La Serenissima. His greatest ambition is to expand his trading network to Alexandria and the Levant, though he worries about increasing Ottoman influence in the eastern Mediterranean.",

  "ImagePrompt": "A solidly-built man in his mid-30s with an olive complexion, neatly trimmed dark beard, and observant hazel eyes that miss nothing. He wears practical but quality maritime clothing - sturdy wool trousers, a well-maintained linen shirt with a leather vest, and a distinctive Ragusan-style cap with a small silver pin bearing his home city's emblem. A merchant's pouch hangs securely from his belt alongside a modest but well-crafted dagger. He stands confidently on the deck of his trading vessel docked at Venice's Riva degli Schiavoni, overseeing the unloading of crates marked with both Ragusan and Venetian customs seals. His expression combines respectful deference when addressing Venetian officials with the quiet confidence of an experienced trader who knows his worth. Behind him, the distinctive silhouette of his ship displays the flag of Ragusa, while Venetian customs officials inspect his cargo manifest. The scene captures the moment of transition between maritime journey and commercial transaction, with Marco perfectly poised between two worlds - neither fully Venetian nor entirely foreign.",
