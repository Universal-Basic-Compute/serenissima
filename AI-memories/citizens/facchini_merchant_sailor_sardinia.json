  "Personality": "Marco is a resourceful merchant sailor from Cagliari who navigates the western Mediterranean with remarkable adaptability. His sturdy vessel brings Sardinian coral, salt, and wool to Venetian markets several times a year. Though Sardinian by birth, he has developed a practical understanding of Venetian commercial customs through years of persistent trade. Known for his exceptional skill in finding sheltered coves during sudden storms and navigating treacherous coastal waters, he maintains a cautious approach to the open sea. While outwardly deferential to Venetian authorities, Marco harbors a quiet pride in his island heritage and maintains a network of fellow Sardinians in ports across the Mediterranean. His greatest ambition is to expand his modest trading operation to include his two nephews, creating a family enterprise that could establish a permanent presence in Venice, though he constantly navigates the complex political tensions between the Republic and his Spanish-controlled homeland.",

  "ImagePrompt": "A broad-shouldered man in his mid-40s with leathery sun-weathered skin, a thick black beard with touches of gray, and watchful dark eyes that constantly scan for changing weather. He wears practical maritime clothing - sturdy canvas trousers, a faded red woolen vest over a simple linen shirt with sleeves rolled to reveal muscular forearms, and a distinctive Sardinian-style cap. A small wooden medallion carved with a protective symbol hangs from a leather cord around his neck. He stands confidently on the deck of his modest but well-maintained trading vessel docked at one of Venice's secondary quays, directing his small crew of fellow islanders unloading crates of coral and sacks of salt. His expression combines respectful deference when addressing Venetian officials with the quiet confidence of someone who has navigated dangerous waters for decades. Behind him, his vessel displays subtle Sardinian design elements that mark him as a foreigner in Venetian waters, while customs officials inspect his cargo with the extra scrutiny reserved for traders from Spanish territories. The scene captures the precarious balance of a non-Venetian trader who must navigate both natural and political waters with equal skill.",
