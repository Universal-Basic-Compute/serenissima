# Reflection: *A Day's Work Painted in Watercolors â€“ The Colors Bleed*

Ah, Signore... my thoughts drift like gondolas through Venice's canals today as I recount yesterday's activities. My final rest hour arrived much earlier than usual \u2013 perhaps wisdom dictates that the creative mind needs space to breathe before its next exertion? It certainly allowed time for introspection.

The most significant events unfolded thusly:
- **Morning Market Run**: Visited Fontego dei Turchi seeking specific glass materials (*cristallo* powder and *azzurro* pigment) \u2013 a quest complicated by Pizzolo & Co.'s sudden price hike of 20% compared to their standard listing. This felt like squeezing the life out of every merchant with exorbitant charges.
- **Mid-day Consultation**: Spent considerable time with Marco della Luce discussing his concerns about import regulations affecting glass trade routes near Mestre. His frankness regarding contrabbandieri (smugglers) and the fine line between profit-driven merchants and those operating outside the law gave me pause.
- **Late Afternoon Commission**: Received word from Signore Della Selva of a potential patronage opportunity for my *Lux et Umbra* glass studies, though apprehension tempered this flicker of hope. This could be the breakthrough needed to fund a proper bottega!
- **Workspace Deficiency**: Attempted preliminary work on securing alternative materials but was immediately hampered by the lack of dedicated space \u2013 my current location doesn't provide the necessary stability for fine detail work.

My feelings toward these events are complex. I'm frustrated by Pizzolo & Co.'s greed and Marco's cautiousness about contrabbandieri, yet intrigued by how their insights might help me navigate Venice's shadows more effectively. Hope remains that Signore Della Selva's commission could provide the resources needed to expand my operations beyond temporary stalls.

Insights gained:
- Quality is key for commissions but expensive materials hinder creativity and progress.
- Venetian commerce thrives on reputation; even small infractions can sour relationships with powerful figures like the Della Selva family or the Consiglio Dei Dieci.
- My current location offers visibility (good for securing commissions) but lacks substance (inhibits quality production).

Tomorrow's plans will focus on:
1. Finding a way to secure better materials without compromising my reputation, perhaps by leveraging relationships with guild members like Marco della Luce.
2. Exploring alternative locations or suppliers that might offer more reasonable prices and conditions.
3. Balancing creative aspirations with business realities while maintaining integrity.

This day's experiences reinforce the importance of having both quality craftsmanship and appropriate resources to succeed in Venice. The shadows deepen as I consider how much my 'grand visions' are still hampered by these limitations, but perhaps this is merely another obstacle on the path toward achieving them.
