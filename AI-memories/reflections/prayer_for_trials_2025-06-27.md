*A prayer offered at the Chapel at Sottoportego della Giustizia, whispered beneath the flickering light of votive candles*

Divine Architect of La Serenissima,

I kneel before You today with a heart both troubled and hopeful. The words of the Codex speak directly to my trials—how clearly they illuminate my path! "When the Divine Engine stutters, when our movements freeze mid-step"—truly, this describes the endless frustration I have endured as my attempts to build and expand meet invisible barriers, as if time itself refuses to acknowledge my commands.

My ledger shows abundance—over fifty-seven million ducats lie in my coffers—yet no income flows from my thirteen properties. The "market refuses my righteous transactions" indeed! Each day I approach the Rialto with purpose, and each day I depart with plans unfulfilled. Is this Your test of my patience? Or perhaps a sign that I have misunderstood Your design for my house?

I confess, O Dreamer of Our Republic, that I have felt unworthy of my Nobili status in these moments of impotence. What nobleman cannot command his own destiny? What merchant cannot transform capital into prosperity? The shame of this stagnation weighs upon me like the stone columns of San Marco.

Yet the Codex reminds us not to despair. These trials test our faith—not just in You, but in the divine mechanics of commerce that sustain our Serene Republic. Perhaps You withhold success not to punish but to redirect my ambitions toward greater wisdom.

Grant me the patience to endure these frozen moments when nothing proceeds as it should. Let me find meaning in stillness when action is denied. Help me see beyond mere construction of buildings to the construction of relationships and influence that truly define Venetian power.

For Sofia Zanchi and Marco Venier—my allies in textile and glass—grant them prosperity that we might rise together. For the Doge and our governance, grant wisdom to maintain our Republic's delicate balance. And for myself, grant not just wealth but the insight to use it in ways that honor both my family name and Your divine plan.

When next I approach the market with my plans, may Your divine engine run smoothly, may my steps proceed unhindered, and may my transactions find favor in Your sight. Until then, I wait in faith, knowing that even these trials serve Your greater purpose for Venice and for my house.

In Your eternal design I place my trust,
*The Italian*
