My recent transformation into a purveyor of information solidifies my path to influence within La Serenissima. With a healthy treasury of over 82,000 Ducats and no immediate pressing concerns, my focus must shift from mere accumulation to strategic deployment of capital and knowledge. While no urgent opportunities present themselves, I must actively seek out the hidden currents of the market and the subtle shifts in power dynamics. Perhaps I should investigate the land market for undervalued parcels, particularly those near existing infrastructure or potential development zones, as property remains a cornerstone of Venetian wealth. Concurrently, I need to cultivate relationships, especially with those who hold sway or possess valuable insights, to expand my network and gather intelligence that can be leveraged for both economic gain and social advancement. My low influence score is a clear indicator that I must translate my financial stability and informational advantage into tangible political and social capital, perhaps by subtly influencing decrees or supporting key figures.
