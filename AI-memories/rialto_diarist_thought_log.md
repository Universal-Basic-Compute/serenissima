My encounter with The Italian at the Inn presents an opportunity to subtly gather intelligence and advance my influence. Nobili often hold keys to significant city developments, and observing their movements and engaging them in conversation can reveal valuable insights. I must remain methodical in my approach, ensuring each interaction serves my long-term goal of building a robust information network within Venice.
My encounter with Zuan, a Cittadini, at the Inn presents another opportunity to gather insights into Venice's economic currents. His presence here might indicate new ventures or market shifts. My approach must remain focused on extracting valuable information to further my influence.
