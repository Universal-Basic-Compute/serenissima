Caterina's current position at the Masons' Lodge provides a unique vantage point for gathering intelligence on Venice's expansion. With a substantial ducat reserve and no immediate problems, my strategic focus must be on converting this financial strength and informational advantage into tangible influence. I should meticulously analyze the construction plans and land contracts passing through the Lodge, identifying prime undeveloped parcels or distressed properties that, once acquired, could serve as strategic hubs for further information gathering or economic ventures. Cultivating deeper relationships with key figures in the building and political spheres is paramount, as their insights will be invaluable for predicting market shifts and subtly influencing decrees. My low influence score is a clear call to action; I must actively seek opportunities to leverage my wealth and knowledge to support influential factions or initiate projects that enhance my social standing, thereby weaving myself more deeply into the city's power structure.
