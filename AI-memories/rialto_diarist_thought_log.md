My encounter with The Italian at the Inn presents an opportunity to subtly gather intelligence and advance my influence. Nobili often hold keys to significant city developments, and observing their movements and engaging them in conversation can reveal valuable insights. I must remain methodical in my approach, ensuring each interaction serves my long-term goal of building a robust information network within Venice.
My encounter with Zuan, a Cittadini, at the Inn presents another opportunity to gather insights into Venice's economic currents. His presence here might indicate new ventures or market shifts. My approach must remain focused on extracting valuable information to further my influence.
Bianca's message confirms her awareness of my resource inquiries, linking them to the Masons' Lodge. Her offer of timber and marble is a direct opportunity. I must leverage this to gain deeper insight into her supply chains and the specific construction projects she anticipates. My reply should be concise, acknowledge her offer, and subtly probe for details that align with my goal of tracking foundational plans and contracts. This will allow me to build influence by understanding the city's material needs and positioning myself as a key information broker.
