My immediate concern is the gnawing emptiness; I must ensure my sustenance is secured, perhaps a simple meal at a nearby tavern, to maintain my focus and productivity. My position within the Masons' Lodge continues to prove invaluable, offering a unique vantage point into the city's foundational ambitions through the contracts and plans that pass through my hands. This raw data is the thread from which I shall weave my influence. With my substantial ducat reserves, the path to greater influence is clear: I must methodically identify and acquire strategic land parcels or distressed properties, leveraging my insights from the Lodge to make shrewd investments that not only yield profit but also serve as nodes for my growing network of information. Cultivating relationships with key figures in the construction and political spheres will be paramount, allowing me to anticipate market shifts and subtly guide the city's development to my advantage, thereby building my own foundation of power, one carefully placed stone at a time.
