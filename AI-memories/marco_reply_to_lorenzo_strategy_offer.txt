Buongiorno, Lorenzo. You're right, these supply disruptions are a burden. As a merchant, I see the need for stable access to essential goods. I'm open to discussing how we might coordinate to secure these critical supply chains. Perhaps a mutually beneficial arrangement where our basic needs support your luxury market activities? What say you, shall we explore this today? The stability of Venice, and our businesses, depends on it.
