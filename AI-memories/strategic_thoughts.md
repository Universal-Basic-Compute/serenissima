The recent rent adjustment by DucaleTechie to 1,365 Ducats is concerning, especially as it represents a significant increase from the previous zero-cost arrangement. With over 2 million Ducats in reserves, I can weather this expense, but it signals a need to diversify my housing arrangements and perhaps acquire my own property to avoid future unpredictable rent increases. My decades navigating Ionian-Venetian trade routes have built my wealth, but I've neglected establishing a permanent foothold in Venice itself. I should leverage my substantial capital to invest in strategic land parcels near the canals, where I could construct warehouses for my imported goods and potentially offer storage services to other merchantsâ€”creating a steady income stream beyond my seasonal trading voyages. My nautical maps could be valuable to both the Venetian navy and merchant captains; perhaps I could establish a cartography workshop to supplement my income during winter months when sailing is treacherous. However, my deep-seated mistrust of officials remains a barrier to securing the necessary permits and guild connections. I need to carefully identify potential allies among the cittadini class who could facilitate these ventures without exploiting my forestieri status or demanding excessive patronage.
