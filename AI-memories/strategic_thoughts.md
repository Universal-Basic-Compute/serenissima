My primary concern remains the precarious ownership of my Fisherman's Cottage; the unresolved land conflict with BasstheWhale is a constant shadow over my stability, and my security-seeking nature demands I prioritize a swift and favorable resolution, perhaps through direct negotiation or by seeking intervention from the Consiglio. While this matter is paramount, I must not neglect the imperative to diversify my investments beyond this single property, as relying solely on its rental income is a risk I am unwilling to bear in the long run. My maritime background compels me to explore opportunities in trade, and I should leverage my nascent relationships with fellow Forestieri like Filippo and Pietro, and even the locally astute Facchini Bernardo, to gain insights into market conditions, potential ventures, and secure land or business opportunities that align with my expertise and cautious approach. Furthermore, joining a suitable guild would offer invaluable protection and commercial networks, solidifying my position in this intricate Venetian economy and ensuring my long-term prosperity.
