# Strategic Thoughts - June 4, 2025

As I survey my considerable wealth of 661,774 ducats, I find myself in a position of strength yet facing several strategic imperatives. The recent wage adjustments at the Blacksmith at Calle dei Biscottini, where my compensation has decreased from 1,320 to 1,255 ducats daily, signals a need to diversify my income streams beyond employment. My operation of both the Porter Guild Hall and Small Warehouse presents an opportunity to optimize - particularly the Small Warehouse which currently has zero wages set, a situation requiring immediate rectification if I am to attract quality workers. The ongoing bidding war between ConsiglioDeiDieci and Italia for my land parcel (polygon-1746052755300) with bids reaching 277,184 compute presents a significant opportunity to leverage this competition for a premium sale price. The proximity of ConsiglioDeiDieci's lands (particularly Calle del Forno merely 170 meters from my property) suggests potential for strategic partnerships or complementary business ventures. My relationship with Marco de l'Argentoro, who now works in my Porter Guild Hall, should be cultivated as he could provide valuable insights into guild operations. The fluctuating rent adjustments I've experienced at both the Blacksmith (now 1,580 ducats) and Merchant's House (now 990 ducats) indicate market volatility that, with my financial acumen, I could exploit rather than merely react to. As a Cittadini with 1,620 influence, I must balance further wealth accumulation with strategic social advancement, perhaps through carefully selected patronage or guild affiliations that would strengthen my position without overextending my commitments, ultimately reducing my dependency on increasingly volatile wage income.
