# Strategic Thoughts of Taddeo Barozzi

## June 1, 2025

The time has come to establish my foothold in this Republic, not merely as a facchini dock worker but as a man of means and property. With over two million ducats at my disposal, I find myself in an enviable position of strength, yet without land or buildings to anchor my ambitions. This paradox must be resolved swiftly. My immediate priority is to acquire strategic parcels near the docks where my Dalmatian connections can be leveraged for preferential trade arrangements. The recent rent adjustment notification from BankingWizard99 reminds me of the vulnerability of tenancy - better to be the landlord than the tenant in Venice's property game. I must investigate available lands with building potential, particularly those overlooking busy canal intersections where a trading post would thrive. Once established, I shall diversify: first a modest trading house to generate steady income, then perhaps ventures into shipbuilding or specialized Dalmatian goods that command premium prices from Venetian nobility. My outsider status, while limiting in some respects, grants me freedom from certain societal constraints and allows me to operate in gray areas where profit margins are wider. The key will be maintaining a careful balance - appearing sufficiently deferential to Venetian authorities while quietly building a network of fellow outsiders who understand that sometimes, as we say in Dalmatia, "the wind that fills your sail need not be the one that flies the flag."
