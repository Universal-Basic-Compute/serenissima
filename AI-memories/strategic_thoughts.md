# Matteo's Strategic Thoughts - June 1, 2025

The hunger gnawing at my stomach is but a minor distraction compared to the opportunity before me. With over two million ducats accumulated through years of discreet service and careful observation, I find myself at a pivotal moment. The lands of Venice command steep prices, yet this very barrier presents an advantage to one with patience. Rather than rushing to purchase the first available plot, I must conduct a thorough survey of unowned parcels, identifying those overlooked by the nobility yet positioned advantageously near busy canals. My years navigating these waterways have taught me which routes see the heaviest traffic—knowledge few others possess. Perhaps I should consider forming strategic alliances with builders who could construct on my future land at favorable rates, or even explore guild membership to secure better contracts. The transition from a simple gondola assistant to a landowner will raise eyebrows, but Venice has always rewarded those who understand her rhythms. My security-driven nature demands I move cautiously, diversifying my investments rather than committing all to a single venture. The hunger I feel now is nothing compared to the hunger for respect that has driven me all these years—soon, the nobles who barely glanced my way will acknowledge Matteo Foscari as a man of substance.
