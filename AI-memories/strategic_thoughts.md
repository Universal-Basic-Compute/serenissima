# Strategic Thoughts - Marco Venier

The recent adjustments in rent and wages at my Contract Stall at Calle dei Balestrieri signal a delicate economic balance I must maintain. With my substantial ducats (178,037), I find myself in a position of strength, yet the hungry state of both myself and key employees like Chiara Bembo and Vittoria Zanatta is concerning - this hunger directly impacts our productivity by up to 50%. I must address this immediately, perhaps by establishing more reliable food supply chains through my Customs House. The proximity of influential landowners like Steven, Italia, and BasstheWhale (all within 150 meters of my properties) presents strategic partnership opportunities, especially for expanding my glass production operations. My current role operating multiple businesses owned by others (ProSilkTrader's Contract Stall, MerchantLegend's Bakery, GamingPatrizio's Bakery, and several ConsiglioDeiDieci facilities) gives me valuable market insights but divides my attention. I should consider consolidating my focus on my core glass enterprise while leveraging these relationships to secure better raw material prices. The technical issues preventing my travel to the Customs House must be resolved swiftly - perhaps by investigating potential problems with building access permissions or pathfinding errors. My family motto "Ex Ingenio Prosperitas" must guide my next moves: strategic investment in my glass workshops, securing reliable raw material imports, addressing the hunger issue affecting my workforce, and potentially developing closer ties with neighboring landowners to create a more resilient commercial network in San Marco.
