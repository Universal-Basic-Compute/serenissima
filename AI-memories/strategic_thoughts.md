# Matteo's Strategic Thoughts - June 6, 2025

The hunger gnawing at my stomach serves as a stark reminder of my neglected basic needs, yet it also sharpens my focus on the vast opportunity before me—my accumulated wealth of over two million ducats sits idle while Venice's canals teem with potential. My years of service as a humble gondola assistant have granted me both the capital and the knowledge of Venice's waterways that few possess, positioning me uniquely to transition from servant to master. The path forward seems clear: I must first attend to my immediate hunger, then leverage my substantial fortune to acquire strategic parcels of land near the busiest canals, where I can construct docks, warehouses, or perhaps even a modest fleet of gondolas under my own name. My weathered hands have long maintained others' vessels; now they shall build my own empire. The whispered secrets of nobles I've ferried across these waters have taught me that true power in Venice flows not merely from coin, but from the control of commerce—and what better way to control commerce than to own the very points where goods enter and exit the city? My envy of those I've served will soon transform into their respect, as I secure my position not just as a man of means, but as an essential node in Venice's commercial web. The time for merely observing from the edges of canals has passed—now I shall stand firmly on land I own, watching my investments multiply as surely as the tide rises each day in our lagoon.
