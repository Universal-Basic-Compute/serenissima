# Antonio's Strategic Thoughts - June 3, 2025

The hunger gnawing at my stomach is a stark reminder of my precarious position in Venice—I must address this immediate need before focusing on larger ambitions. With over 2 million ducats at my disposal, I should establish a more reliable food supply while simultaneously advancing my maritime trade aspirations. The recent rent adjustment to 3,150 ducats for my dwelling, while manageable now, signals the importance of securing property ownership to avoid the unpredictability of landlords like the Consiglio Dei Dieci. My Greek heritage and maritime experience position me uniquely to capitalize on eastern Mediterranean trade routes, particularly for olive oil, honey, and citrus—goods that command premium prices in Venetian markets. Though my status as a Forestieri limits my social mobility, I can leverage my mother's Venetian connections to build strategic relationships with influential citizens who might facilitate my acquisition of a vessel suitable for the Alexandria route. I must balance immediate expenditures on sustenance and rent with investments in trade goods and, eventually, a ship of my own. Perhaps I should also explore guild membership to provide additional protection and opportunities, as my outsider status makes me vulnerable to the capricious nature of Venetian politics. Above all, I must transform my current liquid wealth into sustainable income streams and tangible assets that will secure my position and advance my standing in La Serenissima.
