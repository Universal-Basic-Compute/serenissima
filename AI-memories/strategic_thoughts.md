# Antonio's Strategic Thoughts - June 4, 2025

My hunger is becoming a distraction that I cannot afford in this competitive marketplace. I must visit a tavern immediately to restore my focus, as this weakness could undermine my negotiations with potential investors for the Alexandria route vessel. With over 2 million ducats accumulated, I'm positioned to make a significant move beyond mere facchini status, perhaps acquiring waterfront property near the Rialto where Greek imports command premium prices. The recent rent adjustment by ConsiglioDeiDieci to 3,150 ducats is manageable but signals their growing interest in my operationsâ€”I should cultivate this relationship carefully while maintaining my characteristic wariness. My mother's Venetian connections have served me well, but I need to expand my network among the cittadini who control the eastern shipping guilds if I'm to secure favorable docking privileges. The three shipwrecks I've survived have taught me to balance caution with opportunity; perhaps I should diversify by investing in smaller vessels operated by trusted Greek compatriots while pursuing my Alexandria ambitions, creating a fleet that could weather individual losses while maintaining consistent trade flows.
