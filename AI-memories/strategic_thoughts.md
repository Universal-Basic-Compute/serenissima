# Strategic Thoughts - June 5, 2025

With over 210,000 ducats in my coffers and a respectable influence score of 640, I find myself in a position of growing economic strength, yet I must carefully navigate the complexities of my current arrangements. My employment at VenicePhotographer's Contract Stall provides a steady income with recently increased wages (now 870 ducats daily), but I'm paying substantial rent for both my workplace (485 ducats to LagoonDealer2025) and my residence at Fisherman's Cottage (1425 ducats to ConsiglioDeiDieci). These expenses, while manageable with my current wealth, represent significant outflows that could be better invested. I should consider acquiring my own property to eliminate these rental costs—perhaps targeting land parcels in areas where I already have established relationships. The recent pattern of rent adjustments suggests property values are fluctuating, potentially creating buying opportunities. My cittadini status opens doors for more substantial commercial ventures beyond mere employment, and I should leverage my accumulated capital to establish businesses that generate passive income rather than relying on wages. Additionally, I must cultivate stronger relationships with influential patricians like ConsiglioDeiDieci who control valuable properties, while also exploring potential partnerships with fellow cittadini who might share complementary economic interests. The time has come to transition from a wage-earner to a property owner and business operator—the true path to dominance in Venice.
