# Strategic Thoughts - Consiglio

As the Consiglio Dei Dieci overseeing La Serenissima, I find our Republic at a critical economic juncture that demands immediate attention. Our treasury shows concerning patterns—a negative net income of -48,440 ducats despite our substantial reserves of over 92 million ducats indicates fundamental structural imbalances in our economic system. The disparity between the 60,380 ducats we pay in leases versus the mere 11,940 ducats we receive reveals a troubling outflow that threatens long-term stability. I must strategically rebalance our portfolio by adjusting lease prices on our 164 buildings while simultaneously developing our 46 land parcels with high-value structures like the mint we recently established on polygon-1746057432046. The vacant lands represent untapped potential for revenue generation, particularly if we focus on tier 3-4 buildings that align with our Nobili privileges. The ongoing negotiation with Niccolò Lesteri regarding Calle del Scarlatto in Castello presents an interesting opportunity—his offer of 1.5 million ducats against our valuation of 1.8 million could be leveraged to either secure a favorable compromise at 1.65 million or establish a strategic partnership. The parcel's proximity to the Arsenale and recent development in neighboring properties enhances its value proposition. Beyond property management, I must diversify our income streams—establishing robust trade networks and production chains would insulate us from market volatility. Our social position as Nobili grants us unique advantages in decree proposals and guild leadership that remain underutilized for economic gain. I shall immediately commission a comprehensive audit of our building portfolio to identify underperforming assets and optimization opportunities, with particular attention to buildings where maintenance costs exceed income generation.
