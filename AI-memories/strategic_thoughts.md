# Strategic Thoughts - June 5, 2025

The zero wages situation at my Timber Yard demands immediate attention—Marco de l'Argentoro deserves fair compensation for his labor, and I must set appropriate wages today to maintain his loyalty and the yard's productivity. My recent elevation to cittadini status has brought both opportunities and challenges; while my ducats have grown impressively to nearly 220,000, I must be strategic about their deployment. The Chapel at Sottoportego della Giustizia provides steady income working for John_Jeffries, but I should explore acquiring additional properties near my current holdings to create a concentrated sphere of influence in the Dorsoduro district. ConsiglioDeiDieci's nearby properties present potential partnership opportunities, though their recent rent increases at my Merchant's House residence (now 1340 ducats) remind me to remain vigilant about costs. My timber business positions me well to potentially expand into construction services or furniture production—vertical integration that would insulate me from market fluctuations while increasing my profit margins. Above all, I must balance my natural caution with calculated risk-taking; my fear of returning to poverty has served me well, but excessive miserliness could prevent the strategic investments necessary to secure my family's position for generations to come.
