The recent rent adjustments at both my granary workplace and my fisherman's cottage have me concerned about financial stability despite my substantial ducats reserve of over 200,000. Working for Feola007 at the granary provides steady income, but I should leverage my dock oversight experience and cittadini status to explore additional revenue streams—perhaps establishing my own transportation business connecting the docks to inland warehouses. ConsiglioDeiDieci owns numerous properties near mine, including Campo San Zaccaria and Calle de la Fontana, presenting an opportunity to negotiate favorable terms for potential business locations given our proximity relationship. My obstinate nature has kept me from seeking advice from those born to wealth, but I must overcome this if I'm to expand my economic footprint in Venice. The nearby properties owned by GiovanniContarini and GamingPatrizio could offer partnership opportunities for a transportation network spanning multiple sestieri. With my practical knowledge of dock operations and my understanding of cargo logistics, I could create a specialized service connecting maritime commerce to inland distribution—a niche that would honor my working-class roots while capitalizing on my unique position bridging the laboring and merchant classes of Venice.
