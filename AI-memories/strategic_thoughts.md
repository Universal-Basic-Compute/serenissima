# Strategic Reflections - June 2, 2025

My operation of the Public Dock at Riva dei Vinattieri presents both opportunity and challenge. While the recent wage adjustment to 1465 ducats daily was necessary to maintain profitability amid rising rents from ConsiglioDeiDieci, I must consider more substantial ventures to truly leverage my substantial capital reserves of over 3.8 million ducats. The pattern of increasing rents across my leased properties (rising from 905 to 1230 ducats in mere days) signals a broader economic pressure that demands a strategic response. Rather than remaining a mere operator of others' assets, I must pivot toward property acquisitionâ€”particularly targeting the vacant weighing station I've identified, which would create a crucial node in my envisioned network of trade infrastructure. The competitive bidding between Italia and ConsiglioDeiDieci on polygon-1746056541940 (reaching 2.4 million compute) indicates significant value in strategic land holdings. My proximity to BasstheWhale's numerous properties (151-317 meters from my operations) presents potential partnership opportunities, as coordinated development could enhance value for both parties. The immediate challenge is transforming my substantial liquid assets into productive infrastructure that generates consistent income, moving beyond the current situation where my weekly turnover of 435.96 ducats is disproportionately small compared to my capital base. I must act decisively to establish my own properties rather than continuing to enrich ConsiglioDeiDieci through escalating rents.
