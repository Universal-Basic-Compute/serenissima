# Strategic Thoughts - Bass De Medici

As I survey my commercial empire from my position at the Public Dock, I recognize several strategic imperatives requiring my attention. With nearly 926,000 ducats at my disposal, I must deploy this capital more effectively—particularly by developing the numerous lands on which others have built without proper compensation. The recent flurry of building notifications indicates significant development activity on my properties, yet I've neglected to set appropriate wages for these operations, leaving potential income unrealized. My current rental arrangement at the Merchant's House at Ruga dei Oresi warrants scrutiny as well, with ConsiglioDeiDieci steadily increasing the rent from 1,125 to 1,230 ducats in recent weeks—a concerning trend that may necessitate relocation or negotiation. The numerous public docks and facilities I operate present excellent networking opportunities, particularly with employees like DucatsRunner and DragonSlayer who could become valuable business allies. I should leverage my proximity to influential neighbors like ConsiglioDeiDieci and Feola007 to forge strategic alliances, especially as I notice one of my employees, Beatrice Sanudo, is currently hungry—a situation that not only impacts productivity but reflects poorly on my management. Moving forward, I must systematically address these building operations, establish fair wages, cultivate my network of relationships through my operated facilities, and perhaps diversify my holdings beyond public infrastructure to more profitable ventures, all while maintaining the dignified bearing expected of the De Medici name in Venice.
