The recent rent adjustment for my canal-side dwelling has me reconsidering my financial priorities. With over 2 million ducats at my disposal, I should leverage my nautical expertise more strategically - perhaps by investing in a small fleet rather than merely captaining a single vessel. My Greek-Venetian heritage positions me uniquely to establish stronger trade networks between Venice and the Ionian Islands, particularly focusing on premium currants and olive oil that fetch higher margins in Venetian markets. The mistrust I harbor toward officials has cost me profitable arrangements in the past; I must learn to navigate these relationships more adeptly while maintaining my principles. My cartographic skills represent an untapped revenue stream - I could formalize the sale of my nautical maps to wealthy merchants and naval captains, creating a secondary income source that doesn't require my physical presence at sea. Additionally, I should consider acquiring waterfront property to establish a small shipyard or warehouse, reducing my vulnerability to rent fluctuations while creating opportunities to offer storage services to fellow merchants. The time has come to transform from a solitary sailor into a true maritime entrepreneur with diversified interests spanning trade, cartography, and property.
