# Strategic Thoughts - June 5, 2025

My transition from sea to shore has been more challenging than anticipated, yet I've managed to secure a modest foothold with my fisherman's cottage at Fondamenta dei Castellani Vecchi. The recent tenant changes—first myself, then Sebastiano Grimani, and now Etienne Matous—have provided a steady rental income of around 1,400 ducats, though I must address the concerning revelation that my building sits on land owned by BasstheWhale. This precarious arrangement demands immediate attention; I should either negotiate a formal lease with the landowner to legitimize my position or begin setting aside funds to purchase my own land parcel elsewhere, perhaps closer to fishing grounds where my maritime knowledge could be better leveraged. With over 630,000 ducats accumulated, I have capital to invest, but must balance between securing my position and expanding my modest holdings—perhaps acquiring a small fishing business would align with my expertise while diversifying my income beyond rental properties. The transition from naive sailor to cautious landlord has taught me valuable lessons about Venetian commerce, yet I must remain vigilant; my medallion of St. Nicholas reminds me that even in calm harbors, one must prepare for unexpected storms, especially when building on another's land.
