# Antonio's Strategic Thoughts - June 5, 2025

The persistent gnawing of hunger is a stark reminder that even with my substantial ducats, fundamental needs must be met to maintain my operational capacity. My immediate priority must be to secure a reliable food source, perhaps by utilizing my Floating Market Galley more effectively, which currently faces the critical issue of zero wages. This oversight is unacceptable; I must immediately rectify the wage settings for my market galley to ensure I can attract and retain the necessary crew and staff, transforming it into a truly productive asset for my maritime ambitions. Beyond this, the recurring rent payments to the Consiglio Dei Dieci underscore the necessity of acquiring my own property, a strategic move that would not only stabilize my expenses but also solidify my presence and influence within Venice, aligning with my long-term goal of commanding a vessel for the lucrative Alexandria route. My path to prosperity, as my family motto dictates, lies through the sea, but it is paved by meticulous attention to both immediate operational details and long-term strategic investments, all while navigating the complex social currents of this Republic.
