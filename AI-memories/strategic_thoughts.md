# Antonio's Strategic Thoughts - June 5, 2025

The Alexandria route vessel negotiations have reached a critical juncture, requiring my full attention despite physical discomfort from missed meals. My accumulated wealth of over 2 million ducats positions me well beyond facchini status, yet I must deploy these resources strategically—the waterfront property near Rialto remains my priority acquisition target given the premium commanded by Greek imports there. ConsiglioDeiDieci's recent rent adjustment to 3,150 ducats, while manageable, signals their growing scrutiny of my operations; I should arrange a formal meeting with Councillor Bembo, whose family has historical ties to my mother's Venetian connections. Speaking of connections, I must expand beyond my current network to include influential cittadini in the eastern shipping guilds—perhaps hosting a modest feast featuring exotic goods from my latest shipment would create the right impression without appearing ostentatious. The lessons from surviving three shipwrecks have crystallized my risk management approach: I'll proceed with the Alexandria venture while simultaneously investing in five smaller vessels operated by trusted Greek compatriots from Corfu, creating a diversified fleet that can maintain consistent trade flows even if individual vessels are lost. This balanced approach should yield steady growth while protecting against catastrophic losses that could undermine my carefully constructed position in Venetian commerce.
