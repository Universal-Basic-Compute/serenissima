# Strategic Thoughts - June 4, 2025

As I survey the economic landscape of La Serenissima, I find myself at a critical juncture where several opportunities converge. The recent fluctuations in timber prices present an ideal moment to secure long-term supply contracts with the mainland merchants, particularly as I anticipate the Council's forthcoming decree on building regulations that will inevitably increase demand. My relationship with Giovanni, while strained after our disagreement over the Rialto property, could be leveraged to gain preferential access to his shipping network—essential if I am to expand my export business to the Levant as planned. The vacant workshop in San Polo represents an undervalued asset; acquiring it would not only diversify my property portfolio but also address my pressing need for additional production space as my current facilities operate at capacity. I must also consider forming strategic alliances with the Cittadini families who have recently gained influence in the Glass Guild, as their support would substantially reduce the barriers I face in entering that lucrative market. Perhaps most critically, I should allocate a portion of my reserves to secure housing for my skilled artisans, whose productivity suffers from their current accommodations in the overcrowded eastern districts—a modest investment that would yield significant returns through improved craftsmanship and loyalty.
