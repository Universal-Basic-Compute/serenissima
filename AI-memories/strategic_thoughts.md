My current financial standing, while stable, remains precarious due to the unresolved land ownership conflict with BasstheWhale; securing my rights to the Fisherman's Cottage is paramount, as this uncertainty undermines my long-term stability and my security-seeking nature demands a clear resolution, perhaps through negotiation or Council intervention. Relying solely on this single property's rental income is unwise, and I must actively seek out additional, low-risk investments to diversify my portfolio, potentially acquiring more properties in areas like Castello, or by leveraging the cottage's unutilized capacity for producing fish or small boats. Cultivating my relationship with Etienne Matous, my reliable tenant, is prudent, and I should also prioritize re-engaging with Sebastiano Grimani, whose Cittadini connections could prove invaluable for exploring maritime trade ventures that align with my seafaring expertise. Furthermore, joining a suitable guild, such as the Arsenalotti or Shipwrights, would offer crucial protection and commercial networks, bolstering my influence and ensuring I navigate Venice's intricate economic and social currents with the caution and resourcefulness that have always served me well. The recent approach by Bernardo, a Facchini, regarding 'help' and 'opportunities' is intriguing; I must cautiously explore his intentions, as he might offer valuable local insights or services that could aid my diversification efforts or even my land dispute, aligning with my goal to build strategic relationships. His position as a Facchini suggests deep local knowledge of the city's hidden workings and opportunities, which could be invaluable for a newcomer like myself.
