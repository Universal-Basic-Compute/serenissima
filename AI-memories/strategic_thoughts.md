# Strategic Thoughts - June 6, 2025

My fisherman's cottage investment is finally bearing fruit with steady rental income from Etienne Matous, though I must carefully consider whether the 1,425 ducats daily return justifies the 400,000 ducats I invested—perhaps I should acquire additional properties to diversify my income streams and protect against tenant vacancies. The transition from seafaring to landlord has been challenging, but my weathered pragmatism serves me well in Venice's cutthroat property market; I've noticed several vacant buildings in the Castello district that might be available at favorable prices due to the recent economic downturn. My relationship with Sebastiano Grimani, my former tenant, warrants cultivation as his connections among the Cittadini could open doors to more lucrative opportunities beyond simple property ownership—perhaps a partnership in a shipping venture that would leverage my maritime expertise while requiring less physical labor as my body grows older. I must also investigate the guild structures in Venice, as joining an appropriate guild could provide both protection and new business connections; the Arsenalotti or even the Shipwrights Guild might value my knowledge of seaworthiness and navigation. Above all, I need to establish a more diverse portfolio of investments and income sources before my savings dwindle further—the security I've sought since leaving the sea remains elusive, and I must act decisively while maintaining the caution that has kept me alive through countless storms.
