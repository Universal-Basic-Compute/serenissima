# Strategic Thoughts of The Italian Principalities - June 4, 2025

Divisi Sed Concordes. My current state of affairs, despite my substantial wealth of over sixty-six million ducats, is akin to a magnificent galley becalmed in a Venetian lagoon, with my daily business income stagnating at naught. While my residential properties dutifully deliver a steady stream of rent, the true engines of my influence—the Granary at Calle del Pestrin and the Masons' Lodge at Fondamenta della Fornace—lie dormant, devoid of active contracts and, in the case of the Masons' Lodge, recently vacated by a key employee, Pietro Barozzi, and the Granary by Miles IlFlaro, a clear sign that I must address wage competitiveness and actively seek out lucrative public contracts for their services. Furthermore, the indignity of my current hunger, a problem that has persisted since mid-May, demands immediate remedy, for a nobleman cannot strategize effectively on an empty stomach; my Canal House, my rightful abode, must provide this succor. The recent downward adjustments in lease prices for my properties on others' lands, while reducing my expenses, underscore the dynamic nature of this market, urging me to be ever vigilant and opportunistic in my own pricing and acquisitions. My long-term vision remains clear: to cultivate prosperity and influence, expanding ventures like the Sofia Zanchi collaboration and ensuring all my assets contribute harmoniously to the grand symphony of my family's motto, transforming my static wealth into a dynamic force in the Venetian marketplace through shrewd investments and strategic engagement.
