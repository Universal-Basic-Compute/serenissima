# Strategic Thoughts - June 1, 2025

The recent rent adjustment to 1,575 Ducats for my dwelling has significantly impacted my financial planning, consuming a substantial portion of my modest trading income. Despite having over 2 million Ducats in reserves, I must establish a more sustainable economic foundation in Venice rather than relying on my dwindling savings. My foremost priority is to cultivate stronger connections with fellow southern Italian merchants, particularly those from Sicily and Naples, who might be more receptive to a partnership with a Forestieri like myself. I need to identify underserved trade routes between Sicily and Venice, focusing on specialty Sicilian products—citrus, salt, and wine—that command premium prices in Venetian markets. The prejudice against southern Italians remains a persistent obstacle, but I could leverage this very challenge by creating a niche market for authentic Sicilian goods, marketed with the cultural heritage that Venetian merchants cannot replicate. Perhaps I should investigate acquiring a small warehouse near my current residence to reduce storage costs and establish a more permanent presence. Additionally, I must carefully evaluate whether joining a guild would provide sufficient benefits to offset the membership costs and potential loss of independence that I've always valued as a sailor-merchant from Palermo.
