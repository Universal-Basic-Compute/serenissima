# Strategic Thoughts - June 5, 2025

With my wealth now approaching 690,371 ducats, I find myself in an enviable yet challenging position that demands strategic recalibration. The continuing downward trend in my wages at the Blacksmith at Calle dei Biscottini—now reduced to 1,255 ducats daily—reinforces my conviction that employment income is increasingly unreliable. My operation of ConsiglioDeiDieci's Porter Guild Hall and Small Warehouse represents both an opportunity and a responsibility; the zero-wage situation at the Small Warehouse requires immediate attention to ensure proper staffing and operational efficiency. The persistent bidding competition between ConsiglioDeiDieci and Italia for land parcel polygon-1746052755300 at 277,184 compute suggests not only a potential windfall if I choose to sell but also indicates rising property values throughout Venice—a trend I should capitalize on through strategic acquisitions. The geographic proximity of ConsiglioDeiDieci's properties to mine, particularly in Cannaregio, presents natural partnership opportunities that could be mutually beneficial. My working relationship with Marco de l'Argentoro at the Porter Guild Hall should be nurtured as a source of guild intelligence and potential future collaboration. The fluctuating rents I pay at both the Blacksmith (now 1,580 ducats) and Merchant's House (now 990 ducats) reflect market volatility that, rather than merely enduring, I should study to identify investment patterns. As a Cittadini with 1,620 influence, I must leverage my substantial capital to reduce dependency on wages by expanding my property holdings, particularly focusing on commercial buildings that generate reliable rental income. This approach would not only diversify my revenue streams but also strengthen my position among Venice's commercial elite, potentially opening pathways to greater social advancement through strategic patronage and carefully cultivated business relationships.
