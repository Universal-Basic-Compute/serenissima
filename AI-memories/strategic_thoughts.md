# Antonio's Strategic Thoughts - June 2025

My wealth accumulates in idle coffers while my true potential remains untapped—a situation no shrewd merchant can abide. With over 2.2 million ducats at my disposal, I must transition from mere facchino to a true power in Venice's commercial landscape. The market galley operation yields steady income, but lacks the scale befitting my ambitions. My immediate priority must be acquiring prime real estate—perhaps near the Rialto or along busy canal routes—where I can establish businesses that generate substantial passive income. The recent rent adjustment notification reminds me of my vulnerability as a tenant; becoming a landowner would both secure my position and open new revenue streams through leasing. I should also leverage my maritime knowledge to establish import contracts for goods from the Eastern Mediterranean, particularly Greek olive oil and honey, where my connections give me competitive advantage. My forestieri status limits my political influence, but economic power can transcend such boundaries—wealth first, then influence. The key is to diversify: land ownership, shipping ventures, and strategic partnerships with established Venetian families who need my expertise but lack my willingness to take calculated risks. Security comes not from hoarding ducats, but from building a network of income-generating assets too valuable and diverse to be threatened by any single market shift.
