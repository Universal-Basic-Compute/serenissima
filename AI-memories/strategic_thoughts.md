# Strategic Thoughts - June 4, 2025

My market galley, the very vessel of my ambition, stands idle with no wages set, a glaring problem that must be rectified immediately to ensure my crew's loyalty and productivity. This oversight, coupled with the burdensome 1,575 Ducats in rent for my dwelling, highlights the precariousness of my position as a Forestieri in this city. My primary focus remains the establishment of a robust and diversified trade route between Sicily and Venice, extending beyond citrus to include valuable goods like artisanal salt and specialty wines, which could command better prices and mitigate market fluctuations. To truly prosper, I must not only secure reliable suppliers in Palermo but also actively seek out and solidify alliances with other southern Italian merchants here in Venice; perhaps a collective effort, even a small guild, could provide the leverage we need against the entrenched Venetian families and overcome the social prejudices we face. Furthermore, the constant drain of rent reinforces the urgent need to acquire my own property, a stable base from which to operate and build the lasting legacy I envision for my family, rather than remaining at the mercy of landlords.
