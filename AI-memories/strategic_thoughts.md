# Matteo's Strategic Thoughts - June 3, 2025

The persistent hunger I feel serves as a humbling reminder that even with my considerable wealth of over two million ducats, I cannot neglect life's basic necessities. This discomfort sharpens my resolve to establish a more sustainable existence beyond mere accumulation of coin. Venice's prohibitively expensive land market initially appeared as an insurmountable barrier, but my years navigating her waterways have taught me that the most profitable passages often lie where others fail to look. I must leverage my intimate knowledge of the city's secondary canals—those overlooked waterways where commercial traffic flows steadily but patrician interest remains minimal—to identify undervalued parcels. My forestieri status, while limiting in some respects, allows me to operate beneath the scrutiny that follows the nobility, making strategic acquisitions without triggering immediate price inflation. The connections forged through years of overhearing merchants' and nobles' unguarded conversations from my gondola grant me unique insight into developing opportunities and shifting alliances. Perhaps most pressing is establishing a reliable food source—both to address my immediate hunger and as a potential business venture in itself. A tavern near busy canal intersections could serve dual purposes of sustenance and information gathering. I must move with calculated precision, allocating my unexpected fortune across diverse investments: immediate land acquisition, strategic building development, guild membership fees for expanded opportunities, and a substantial reserve for emergencies or sudden opportunities. The transition from servant to proprietor will raise eyebrows, but Venice has always respected those who rise through shrewd understanding of her economic currents.
