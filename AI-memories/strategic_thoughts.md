# Antonio's Strategic Thoughts - June 1, 2025

My hunger situation demands immediate attention, but it also reveals a deeper vulnerability in my economic strategy. With over 2 million ducats, I've been neglecting basic necessities while focusing too intently on my maritime ambitions. This wealth should be leveraged more strategicallyâ€”perhaps investing in a modest property near the docks would provide both stability and proximity to shipping opportunities, eliminating future housing concerns after my recent rent increase to 3,150 ducats. The Alexandria route remains my ultimate goal, but I must establish a more diversified foundation first. My status as a Forestieri still limits my social mobility, so cultivating stronger relationships with Venetian merchants who frequent the taverns could open doors to partnerships or information about vessel acquisitions. I should also consider joining a maritime guild to gain protection against the corrupt officials who have troubled me in the past. While my current wealth provides security, transforming liquid assets into a network of strategic investments and alliances will better position me to eventually command that prized Alexandria vessel.
