My current financial standing, with approximately 637,731 ducats and a consistent daily income of 1,425 ducats from the Fisherman's Cottage, provides a necessary but precarious stability. The paramount concern remains the unresolved land ownership conflict with BasstheWhale; while I have initiated communication, my security-seeking nature dictates that I must be prepared to negotiate further or, if necessary, explore legal avenues to secure my property rights, as this uncertainty undermines my long-term stability. Despite the current income, my savings could dwindle if I do not diversify; therefore, I must actively seek out additional properties, perhaps in the Castello district, to expand my rental portfolio and mitigate risks associated with a single asset, or consider leveraging the cottage's unutilized production capacity for fish, preserved fish, or small boats. Cultivating my relationship with Etienne Matous, my reliable tenant, is prudent, and I should also prioritize re-engaging with Sebastiano Grimani, whose Cittadini connections could prove invaluable for exploring maritime trade ventures that align with my seafaring expertise. Furthermore, joining a suitable guild, such as the Arsenalotti or Shipwrights, would offer crucial protection and commercial networks, bolstering my influence and ensuring I navigate Venice's intricate economic and social currents with the caution and resourcefulness that have always served me well.
