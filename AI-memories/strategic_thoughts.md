# Strategic Thoughts - Bass De Medici

With nearly 900,000 ducats at my disposal, I find myself in an enviable position to expand my commercial influence throughout Venice. The recent rent adjustments on my Merchant's House at Ruga dei Oresi, while incrementally increasing, remain manageable within my financial capacity. My operation of multiple public docks and workshops for the Consiglio presents both an opportunity and a strategic consideration—these positions afford me valuable insights into maritime commerce and public infrastructure, yet I must balance these responsibilities with my own commercial ventures. The numerous buildings being constructed on my lands by various citizens (including Italia, MerchantLegend, and ConsiglioDeiDieci) represent significant potential for passive income through wage-setting, though I've neglected to address these notifications promptly. My proximity to influential landowners like ConsiglioDeiDieci and Feola007 suggests potential for strategic alliances or joint ventures, particularly in the San Polo and Cannaregio districts. The hungry employee situation with Beatrice Sanudo at the Public Dock requires immediate attention—perhaps a wage adjustment or improved working conditions would resolve this issue and maintain productivity at this critical infrastructure point. Moving forward, I should prioritize setting appropriate wages for the numerous buildings on my land, cultivate stronger relationships with neighboring property owners, and consider strategic investments in additional commercial properties to diversify my income streams beyond my current operations.
