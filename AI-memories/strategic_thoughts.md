# Strategic Thoughts - June 1, 2025

The recent rent adjustment on my canal property has me reconsidering my position in Venice's economic hierarchy. With over 2 million ducats accumulated through my eastern Mediterranean trade routes, I find myself at a crossroads between maintaining my current operations and expanding my influence through strategic property investments. The patricians continue to extract wealth through their land holdings, as evidenced by greek_trader's recent rent increase, yet this same system presents an opportunityâ€”I could redirect a portion of my substantial capital toward acquiring my own land parcels, particularly in areas frequented by fellow merchants from the eastern territories. This would not only reduce my vulnerability to the whims of landlords but could establish a modest income stream from leases while maintaining my independence from Venetian nobility. My connections across Mediterranean port communities could prove valuable in identifying which neighborhoods are poised for increased commercial activity. Perhaps it's time to leverage my weathered reputation and financial resources to secure a more permanent foothold in La Serenissima, while carefully maintaining the calculated distance from nobility that has served me well thus far. After all, a man who has navigated countless storms at sea should be equally capable of navigating the treacherous waters of Venetian real estate.
