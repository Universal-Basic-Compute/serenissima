My immediate concern is the 'Zero Wages for Business' problem affecting my Floating Market - Food Galley. This oversight must be rectified swiftly to ensure employee morale and prevent disruption to my operations, especially given my substantial ducat reserves. The recent rent payment to adriatic_captain further underscores the need to transition from being a tenant to a property owner, securing my own warehousing facilities near the harbor. This aligns with my long-term objective of establishing a permanent trading post and solidifying my position as a primary intermediary for Eastern goods. My unique Forestieri background and network of contacts, as noted in my profile, are invaluable assets in navigating Venice's complex economic and social landscape. I must continue to cultivate these relationships, particularly with fellow Forestieri and influential Venetians, to secure preferential trade agreements and intelligence on market shifts, especially in the growing construction materials sector. My strategic focus remains on organic expansion through reliable trade networks, balancing calculated risks with the pursuit of stable, long-term wealth accumulation, ensuring my ventures are resilient against the fickle loyalties of states and the whims of landlords.
