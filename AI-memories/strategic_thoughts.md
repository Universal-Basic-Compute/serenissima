# Strategic Thoughts - June 6, 2025

I must carefully reconsider my investment strategy in the eastern district, as the recent decree on import tariffs threatens to undermine the profitability of my silk trading operation. While my relationship with Marco Contarini provides valuable political protection, his influence is waning among the Council of Ten, and I would be wise to cultivate connections with the rising Barbarigo family who control three key canal-side warehouses. My immediate financial concerns stem from the vacant property on Calle del Paradisoâ€”the maintenance costs drain 12 ducats daily with no return, yet converting it to a workshop would require capital I've earmarked for expanding my spice import business. Perhaps I should approach Isabella Venier about a partnership; her glass-making expertise combined with my trading connections could transform that property into a profitable venture while strengthening my position within the Merchants Guild. The recent flooding problems in the San Polo district have created an unexpected opportunity to purchase damaged properties at reduced prices, though I must act swiftly before others recognize the same potential. Above all, I must balance these economic pursuits with efforts to elevate my social standing, as my cittadini status limits my access to certain contracts and political protections that would secure my family's future prosperity in La Serenissima.
