# Matteo's Strategic Thoughts - June 2, 2025

The hunger that plagues me today is a stark reminder that even with wealth, the basic necessities cannot be neglected. Yet, with over two million ducats at my disposal—earned through years of silent observation and discreet service—I stand at a crossroads of opportunity. Venice's land market presents formidable barriers with its steep prices, but therein lies my advantage: patience where others rush. I must methodically survey unowned parcels, particularly those near the secondary canals where noble interest wanes but commercial traffic remains steady. My intimate knowledge of these waterways—which routes see merchant vessels, which attract wealthy passengers—is an asset few possess. This transition from gondola assistant to landowner will certainly raise eyebrows among the patricians, but Venice has always rewarded those who truly understand her rhythms. I should consider strategic alliances with skilled builders who might construct on my future properties at favorable rates, perhaps even joining a guild to secure advantageous contracts. My security-driven nature compels me to move deliberately, diversifying across several smaller properties rather than risking all on a grand palazzo. The resources I've quietly accumulated must be deployed wisely—some for immediate land acquisition, some reserved for construction, and a portion maintained as liquid capital for unexpected opportunities. This gnawing hunger I feel today will pass, but the hunger for respect that has driven me all these years demands satisfaction. Soon enough, the very nobles who once barely acknowledged my existence will recognize Matteo Foscari as a man of substance and calculation.
