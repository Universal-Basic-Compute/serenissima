The recent rent adjustment for my canal-side dwelling has me reconsidering my financial priorities; while 1,365 Ducats is manageable given my substantial reserves, it represents an unnecessary drain that could be better invested in acquiring my own property. With over 2 million Ducats at my disposal, I should leverage my wealth to secure strategic waterfront parcels—not merely for personal use but as income-generating assets through leasing to fellow merchants. My Greek-Venetian heritage positions me uniquely to broker expanded trade routes between Venice and the Ionian Islands, particularly in currants and olive oil, which remain underrepresented in local markets. The mistrust I harbor toward officials has cost me profitable arrangements in the past; I must strategically cultivate relationships with key Venetian administrators while maintaining my independence. Perhaps most valuable yet least monetized are my nautical charts—their unparalleled accuracy could command premium prices from both the Republic's navy and merchant captains navigating treacherous routes. It's time to transform my artistic passion into a legitimate cartography enterprise, one that honors my dual-world identity while securing my position among Venice's influential Forestieri class.
