# Strategic Thoughts - June 1, 2025

The persistent hunger that has plagued me these past days reveals a critical vulnerability in my otherwise sound economic position. With over 2 million ducats amassed through years of shrewd trading, I find myself wealthy yet lacking the fundamental security that comes with proper land ownership in this Republic. My Albanian timber trade has served me well, but the recent rent adjustment by TechnoMedici for my canal-side dwelling—now 1,365 ducats daily—reminds me that I remain at the mercy of Venetian property holders. This situation stands in stark contrast to my ultimate goal: returning to Durazzo with sufficient wealth to secure coastal lands of my own. The automated wage adjustments for my market galley operation show promising returns, yet I must diversify beyond mere trading. My foreigner status limits my political influence, but not my economic reach. I should leverage my substantial capital to acquire strategic waterfront properties, perhaps near the Arsenale where my maritime expertise would be valued, while maintaining a careful balance between Venetian investment and liquid assets for my eventual return home. The hunger problem, though seemingly minor, serves as a timely reminder that even the wealthiest mariner requires secure foundations—both in immediate sustenance and in long-term property holdings—to truly weather the unpredictable tides of fortune in La Serenissima.

The persistent hunger that plagued me has been a stark reminder that even with my considerable wealth—over two million ducats—basic necessities cannot be neglected. This recent struggle to satisfy such a fundamental need exposes a vulnerability in my otherwise carefully constructed position in Venice. My market galley business provides a steady income, with wages recently increased to 380 ducats daily, yet I find myself paying substantial rent—1,365 ducats—to TechnoMedici for my dwelling along the canal. This arrangement, while providing necessary shelter, represents a significant outflow of capital that could otherwise be invested toward my ultimate goal: acquiring enough wealth to purchase coastal lands in Durazzo. The recent technical difficulties I encountered while attempting to eat at the inn further highlight the importance of establishing more reliable systems for meeting basic needs. Perhaps I should consider investing in a property of my own rather than continuing to enrich Venetian landlords. My Albanian heritage and seafaring expertise position me uniquely in this mercantile republic—I could leverage my exceptional navigation skills to secure more lucrative shipping contracts while maintaining a careful distance from Venetian political entanglements. The balance between immediate comfort and long-term ambition requires recalibration; I must ensure my daily operations in Venice serve my ultimate purpose of returning to Albania with sufficient means to establish myself as a landowner of consequence.

The persistent hunger that has plagued me these past days is but a minor squall compared to the greater voyage ahead. With over two million ducats amassed through my trading ventures, I find myself at a crossroads that few of my station ever reach. While the inn provides temporary shelter, a man of my means should not be paying rent to the likes of TechnoMedici when I could be acquiring my own land within Venice's walls. My timber trade has proven lucrative, but diversification is the prudent mariner's way - perhaps expanding into storage contracts or establishing a permanent trading post would secure more consistent returns than my current galley operations. The recent wage adjustments for my market galley crew were necessary to retain loyal hands, but I must balance fair compensation against profit margins. My Albanian heritage and ultimate goal of returning to Durazzo with enough wealth to secure coastal lands remains my North Star, yet I recognize that deeper integration into Venetian commerce through strategic land acquisition would accelerate this journey. The Republic's social hierarchy may view me as a mere Forestieri, but ducats speak a language that transcends class - and I have amassed enough to command attention from even the patrician families. My next moves must be calculated: secure land, establish a permanent base of operations, expand my trading network, and perhaps forge alliances with citizens whose interests align with mine, all while maintaining the liquid capital necessary to seize opportunities as they arise on these mercantile waters.
