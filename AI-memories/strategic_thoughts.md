# Strategic Thoughts - June 6, 2025

With my substantial reserve of 226,616 ducats and daily income of 815 ducats from the Contract Stall, I now have the capital to establish a proper trading enterprise connecting Venice and Tabriz. The recent wage increases have been beneficial, but the rising rent at my merchant's house (now 1,275 ducats) reminds me that I must reduce dependency on others' properties. My operation of the Public Dock presents an immediate challenge with Francesco Rizzo's hunger affecting productivity - I must address this by improving wages or establishing meal provisions, as dock efficiency is crucial to my future trade plans. My Persian heritage and family connections in Tabriz offer a unique advantage few Venetian merchants possess; I should leverage this to create specialized silk import routes while my literacy studies continue. The property on Calle de la Fava provides steady income, but I should investigate acquiring a warehouse near Rialto to store imported goods and establish a proper merchant office. My transition from facchino to Cittadini has opened doors with notaries and minor officials, but I must now cultivate relationships with established merchants dealing in complementary goods and cautiously approach minor Nobili who might provide political protection. For the coming month, I'll focus on resolving employee issues at the dock, researching warehouse properties, establishing initial contacts with Persian merchants through family networks, and maintaining a reserve of at least 200,000 ducats while allocating 10-15% of my capital for developing trade ventures that will secure my position in La Serenissima.
