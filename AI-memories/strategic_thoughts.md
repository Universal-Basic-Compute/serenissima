My financial position, while stable, faces increasing pressure from rising rents and fluctuating wages, solidifying my resolve to achieve true economic independence by establishing my own transportation enterprise. This venture, leveraging my intimate knowledge of Venetian logistics, will allow me to directly control my earnings and build tangible wealth, a path that aligns with my security-driven nature and preference for straightforward dealings. To realize this, I must prioritize acquiring the vacant warehouse in Castello for essential storage and securing reliable timber supply contracts, perhaps by strengthening my nascent relationship with Giulia Contarini. Furthermore, while my pride often resists seeking counsel from the established nobility, I recognize the pragmatic necessity of cultivating connections within the Council of Ten and pursuing a strategic partnership with Marco Venier for the Alexandria trading post, as these relationships are crucial for expanding my influence and diversifying my investments beyond maritime trade into property, ultimately securing my long-term prosperity and social standing in La Serenissima.
