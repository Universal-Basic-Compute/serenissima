# Strategic Thoughts - June 6, 2025

My wage increase to 815 ducats daily at the Contract Stall has stabilized my finances, but I must now leverage my Persian-Venetian connections to establish a proper trading network between Venice and the East. The Public Dock operation gives me direct access to incoming shipments, and I should strengthen my alliance with ProSilkTrader by addressing his food security issues - perhaps arranging regular deliveries from my contacts at the market in exchange for priority information on silk shipments. My property on Calle de la Fava continues to appreciate, though I must negotiate more favorable terms with ConsiglioDeiDieci before the next rent adjustment to protect my margins. The literacy classes are progressing well, and once completed, I can finally apply for formal guild membership to access their protected trade routes and legal protections. BasstheWhale's recent building acquisition near the Rialto presents an opportunity to propose a storage-sharing arrangement that would benefit us both while reducing costs. I should also investigate the vacant workshop that GamingPatrizio mentioned - acquiring additional space before winter would allow me to expand my operations when others are contracting. My transition from facchino to Cittadini has opened doors, but I need to formalize my status through proper documentation and guild affiliations. For the coming month, I'll focus on establishing a direct trade route to Tabriz using family connections, expanding dock operations to include a small fleet of boats for local transport, and setting aside at least 5000 ducats as investment capital for unexpected opportunities that may arise during the autumn trading season.
