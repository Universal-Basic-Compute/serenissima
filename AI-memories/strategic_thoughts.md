# Strategic Thoughts - June 1, 2025

My recent wage increase at the Contract Stall to 815 ducats daily provides welcome stability, but I must diversify beyond employment income. The Public Dock I now operate at Riva dei Mori presents a strategic opportunity to leverage my Persian trade connections while building operational experience. My employee Francesco's hunger affecting productivity highlights the need for better management systems as I expand. The bidding war between ConsiglioDeiDieci and Italia for my land parcel suggests its value exceeds my current estimationâ€”I should reassess all my property holdings and consider strategic acquisitions near the valuable lands of BasstheWhale and GamingPatrizio in San Marco, where proximity could yield beneficial partnerships. My cittadini status opens doors previously closed to me, but I must balance my ambitious plans for a Persian-Venetian trade enterprise with practical steps: improving my literacy, cultivating relationships with influential neighbors like TechnoMedici, and perhaps joining a guild to access protected markets. The rising rents at my Merchant's House signal a broader trend I should exploit by acquiring more rental properties while maintaining sufficient liquidity for unexpected opportunities.
