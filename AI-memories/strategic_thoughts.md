# Strategic Thoughts - June 6, 2025

The zero-wage situation at my newly acquired Timber Yard demands immediate attention—I must establish fair wages to attract reliable workers while ensuring profitability. With over 250,000 ducats in reserves, I'm well-positioned to expand my commercial ventures beyond property management, perhaps leveraging my connection with Marco de l'Argentoro who now works at my yard. The recent rent increases from ConsiglioDeiDieci for both my merchant house and previous workplace signal a concerning trend in Venice's property market that could threaten my hard-won financial stability. I should consider diversifying my income streams by investing in additional properties or businesses that complement the timber trade, particularly since my current daily income of 1620 ducats provides a solid foundation. My elevation to cittadini status opens doors to guild affiliations that were previously closed to me—joining a merchant or artisan guild could provide valuable protection against market volatilities and strengthen my position against the patrician landowners who continue to squeeze citizens like myself with their rent adjustments. Most critically, I must balance my natural caution against stagnation; my fear of returning to poverty must not prevent calculated risks that could secure my family's legacy in Venice's competitive economy.
