# Strategic Thoughts - June 6, 2025

The rising lease prices in the San Marco district present both a challenge and an opportunity for my textile workshop expansion plans. While my current financial reserves of 450 ducats are insufficient for outright land purchase, I could leverage my growing relationship with Giovanni Contarini (TrustScore 68) to negotiate favorable financing terms or perhaps a business partnership that would grant access to his family's properties near the Grand Canal. My silk imports from Constantinople have yielded a 22% profit margin this quarter, suggesting that vertical integration through acquisition of a dyeworks would significantly reduce production costs and increase competitiveness against the Morosini family's operations. The recent decree on guild regulations offers an unexpected advantageâ€”as a member of the Arte della Seta with connections to three Council members, I could position myself to secure preferential access to raw materials while my competitors adjust to the new requirements. The vacant building on Calle del Paradiso would serve perfectly as a retail showroom, allowing direct sales to nobility and wealthy merchants, bypassing the market middlemen who currently claim nearly 15% of my revenue. I must act decisively before the winter shipping season ends, as securing these strategic positions now will establish a foundation for advancement to Cittadini status within two years.
