# Strategic Thoughts - Bass De Medici

As I survey my commercial interests across Venice, I recognize the need to diversify my revenue streams beyond my current operations. With over 925,000 ducats at my disposal, I should leverage my substantial capital to acquire strategic properties, particularly in areas adjacent to ConsiglioDeiDieci's holdings, which could yield valuable political connections. The recent rent increases at my Merchant's House at Ruga dei Oresi, while manageable, remind me that I must establish more self-owned properties to reduce vulnerability to others' pricing decisions. My position operating multiple public docks and workshops for ConsiglioDeiDieci presents an opportunity to strengthen this relationship while gathering intelligence on shipping patterns that could inform future investments. The hungry employee situation with Beatrice Sanudo at the Public Dock requires immediate attentionâ€”perhaps adjusting wages to ensure workers can afford adequate meals would improve productivity and loyalty. I should also address the numerous building creation notifications on my lands by setting appropriate wages to maximize returns while maintaining worker satisfaction. With my Cittadini status and banking family connections, I'm well-positioned to expand into financing ventures for ambitious builders like Italia and MerchantLegend, who have shown interest in developing on my lands. This calculated approach to property management, strategic relationships, and financial services should secure my family's prosperity for generations.
