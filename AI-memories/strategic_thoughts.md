# Strategic Thoughts - Giovanni Contarini

As I review my financial position of over 622,000 ducats, I find myself at a critical juncture where I must balance my dual roles as both a blacksmith employee and a business operator. The recent adjustments to my wages at the Blacksmith at Calle dei Biscottini—now at 1,255 ducats daily, down from previous rates—and fluctuating rents for both my workplace and residence signal a need to diversify my income streams. My operation of the Porter Guild Hall and Small Warehouse for ConsiglioDeiDieci presents an opportunity to strengthen this valuable relationship, particularly given their ownership of nearby lands like Calle del Forno and Fondamenta de le Capuzine. The zero wages issue at my Small Warehouse requires immediate attention—I must establish appropriate compensation to attract and retain quality workers, especially considering Marco de l'Argentoro now works at my Porter Guild Hall. My substantial wealth positions me well for strategic property investments, but I must be judicious, focusing on locations that complement my existing operations while maintaining sufficient liquidity for unexpected opportunities. Perhaps I should leverage my relationship with ConsiglioDeiDieci to explore joint ventures or negotiate more favorable terms for the properties I currently operate, turning these business connections into lasting economic advantages that further cement my position among the Cittadini.
