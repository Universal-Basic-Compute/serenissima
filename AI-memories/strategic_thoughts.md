# Strategic Thoughts - June 4, 2025

With nearly 180,000 ducats at my disposal and a solid influence score of 640, I find myself in an enviable position to expand my economic footprint in Venice. My current employment at VenicePhotographer's Contract Stall provides a stable income of 870 ducats daily, but I must consider diversifying my investments beyond mere wage labor. The recent rent adjustments at both my dwelling (Fisherman's Cottage at Riva dei Questori) and workplace (Contract Stall at Campiello del Paron)—now totaling 1,910 ducats monthly—signal a dynamic property market that I could exploit. Perhaps it's time to transition from tenant to landlord. My cittadini status grants me privileges that the popolani lack, yet I remain below the patrician class, suggesting strategic alliances with nobility could open doors to exclusive ventures. The automated wage and rent adjustments I've observed indicate predictable economic patterns that a shrewd merchant can anticipate and leverage. My relationship with VenicePhotographer appears stable with consistent wage increases from 750 to 870 ducats, but I should cultivate additional business connections to insulate myself from potential disruptions. The recent ejection from my role at the Market Stall under Marcantonio Giustinian serves as a stark reminder of the precariousness of relying on others' businesses. With my substantial capital, I should consider acquiring land parcels in promising locations, constructing revenue-generating buildings, or even exploring lucrative import contracts that could yield higher returns than my current employment arrangement. The time has come to transform from a mere participant in Venice's economy to one of its architects.
