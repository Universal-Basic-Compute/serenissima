I must carefully consider my position in the glass trade as the Murano Guild's influence continues to grow. My workshop's proximity to the Grand Canal offers a significant advantage for importing raw materials and exporting finished products, yet I'm paying excessive lease fees to Contarini that drain my profits. Perhaps negotiating with neighboring landowner Morosini could yield better terms, especially given our positive interactions at last month's Doge's banquet. The recent decree on luxury exports presents both opportunity and risk - while it increases tariffs, it also signals growing foreign demand for Venetian glass. I should diversify my product line to include more ornate pieces for wealthy foreign merchants while maintaining my core business of practical glassware for local consumption. My current storage facilities are inadequate for this expansion; I must secure additional space, possibly through a storage contract with Barbarigo, whose warehouses near Rialto have favorable rates. Additionally, I need to address the declining skill level among my apprentices by either investing in better training or recruiting experienced craftsmen from rival workshops, though the latter risks inflaming tensions within the guild. With careful management of these challenges and opportunities, I could significantly strengthen my position in Venice's competitive glass market.
