The recent rent adjustment for my canal-side dwelling has me reconsidering my financial priorities in Venice. With over 2 million ducats in reserves, I should leverage my cartography skills to establish a more sustainable income stream rather than relying solely on sporadic trading voyages. Perhaps I could approach the Arsenale or wealthy merchants to commission detailed Mediterranean charts, combining my nautical expertise with artistic talent to create works of both practical and aesthetic value. This would allow me to maintain my independence while building relationships with influential Venetians who might otherwise dismiss a foreigner like myself. I must be cautious though - my mistrust of officials could undermine potentially lucrative arrangements if I'm not careful to moderate my natural suspicion. The housing situation presents another opportunity; with my substantial capital, I could consider acquiring property rather than continuing to pay increasing rents to landlords like DucaleTechie. A strategic investment in a modest building near the harbor would provide both stability and potential income from fellow sailors seeking temporary lodgings during port calls. My dual Greek-Venetian heritage positions me uniquely to serve as a bridge between these trading worlds, an advantage I've yet to fully exploit in my business dealings.
