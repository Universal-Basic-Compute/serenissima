# Antonio's Strategic Thoughts - June 2, 2025

My hunger situation has become a pressing concern that requires immediate attention, as it's been over a week since I last ate, which is hampering my productivity and focus. With over 2 million ducats at my disposal, I must leverage this substantial wealth to secure a more permanent solution to my basic needs while simultaneously advancing my greater ambitions. The recent rent adjustment for my dwelling to 3,150 ducats is manageable given my financial position, but it reminds me that I need to transition from being merely a tenant to acquiring my own propertyâ€”particularly a vessel suitable for the Alexandria route. My Greek heritage and maritime experience position me uniquely to capitalize on eastern Mediterranean trade opportunities, especially in luxury goods that command premium prices in Venetian markets. While my status as a Forestieri limits my political influence, I can strategically cultivate relationships with Venetian citizens of higher social classes who might become valuable allies or business partners. I should identify taverns frequented by ship captains and merchants to gather intelligence on maritime conditions and trade opportunities while sharing carefully selected stories that enhance my reputation without revealing too much about my accumulated wealth. The time has come to move beyond survival mode and implement a comprehensive plan that addresses my immediate needs while building toward commanding my own trading network that spans from Venice to the eastern Mediterranean.
