# Strategic Thoughts - June 1, 2025

As I review my financial position with over 2.2 million ducats, I must consider how to best leverage this wealth to secure my family's future in Venice. The rising rents on my workshop in Murano and my granary operation are concerning—ConsiglioDeiDieci has increased them consistently over the past weeks, with the granary now at 2,745 ducats and my other property at 1,230 ducats. These escalating costs threaten my profit margins. I should investigate acquiring my own land to escape this rental cycle, perhaps bidding on parcels near my current operations where I've noticed significant bidding activity. The zero wages situation at my granary requires immediate attention—while it preserves capital, it risks worker dissatisfaction and potential departure. My proximity to ConsiglioDeiDieci's properties presents both opportunity and challenge; I could propose a strategic partnership to stabilize rents or negotiate better terms given my substantial business presence. Additionally, I should explore expanding my glassblowing enterprise by investing in new techniques or rare materials that would appeal to patrician clients, particularly leveraging my existing connections with noble families who display my work. The nearby property owned by BasstheWhale might offer collaboration possibilities for resource sharing or joint ventures. With my cittadini status, I must balance immediate business concerns with longer-term social advancement strategies, perhaps through guild leadership or charitable contributions that enhance my family's standing while creating beneficial economic alliances.
