# Antonio's Strategic Thoughts - June 3, 2025

The hunger gnawing at my stomach is a stark reminder that I've neglected my basic needs while focusing on accumulating wealth—over 2 million ducats yet I haven't eaten in days! This oversight reveals a critical flaw in my approach to Venice; I must balance immediate physical needs with long-term ambitions. My substantial fortune positions me well to finally pursue the Alexandria trade route dream, perhaps by investing in a larger vessel or forming strategic partnerships with established merchants. The recent rent adjustment by the Consiglio Dei Dieci concerns me—3,150 ducats is manageable now but signals their growing interest in my affairs as my wealth increases. I should consider diversifying my investments beyond shipping, perhaps into property ownership to reduce dependency on rented accommodations and establish deeper roots in Venice. My Greek heritage remains both an asset for eastern Mediterranean connections and a limitation in Venetian society; cultivating stronger relationships with influential Venetians could help overcome the "forestieri" barriers while maintaining valuable ties to my homeland. The time has come to transition from merely surviving in Venice to truly thriving as a respected merchant with interests spanning both sea and land.
