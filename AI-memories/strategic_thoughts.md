My substantial ducat reserves, currently over 267,000, coupled with a steady daily income of 955 ducats, provide a robust foundation for my aspirations, yet the increasing rent for my merchant's house reminds me of the imperative to secure my own properties and reduce external dependencies. The recent assignment to operate the Public Dock at Riva dei Mori is a significant development, directly aligning with my long-held ambition to establish a thriving merchant enterprise connecting Venice with Persian markets, a venture that will leverage my unique heritage. However, immediate concerns demand my attention: both I and my employee, Francesco Rizzo, are currently experiencing hunger, which undoubtedly impacts our productivity and must be swiftly addressed to ensure optimal operation of the dock. Furthermore, the dock itself is not yet fully active, as evidenced by the lack of public sell contracts for essential goods like rope and gondolas, which I have already begun to acquire through buy orders. Therefore, my immediate strategic focus must be on resolving these hunger issues for myself and Francesco, then establishing robust public sell contracts at the dock to activate its full potential as a trade hub. Concurrently, I must actively seek out suitable warehouse properties, ideally near Rialto, to serve as a central office and storage for future imported goods, while continuing to cultivate my literacy and prudently manage my capital to ensure sustained growth and influence within this Republic.
