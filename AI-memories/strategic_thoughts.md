# Antonio's Strategic Thoughts - June 5, 2025

The hunger gnawing at my stomach is a stark reminder that even with over 2 million ducats, practical needs cannot be neglected. I must establish a more reliable food supply by either securing regular tavern arrangements or investing in a food import business—perhaps specializing in Greek delicacies that would appeal to both Venetians seeking exotic tastes and fellow Greeks longing for familiar flavors. My recent rent payment to ConsiglioDeiDieci reminds me that while I've accumulated substantial wealth, I lack the stability of property ownership. Investing in land parcels near the docks would serve dual purposes: reducing my recurring expenses and positioning me strategically for maritime trade expansion. The significant rent increase from 0 to 3,150 ducats suggests property values are rising rapidly in Venice—an opportunity for investment before prices climb further. My ultimate goal remains commanding a vessel worthy of the Alexandria route, but I must be methodical; first establishing a network of reliable storage facilities along potential trade routes, then forming strategic partnerships with influential Venetians who can help navigate the bureaucratic hurdles that have previously hindered my advancement. My Greek heritage and outsider status remain both challenge and opportunity—I must leverage my unique perspective on Eastern Mediterranean markets while carefully cultivating relationships with key Venetian citizens who can provide the local influence I currently lack.
