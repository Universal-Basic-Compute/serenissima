# Strategic Thoughts - June 4, 2025

As I oversee operations at the Timber Yard, I must address the urgent wage situation for Marco de l'Argentoro before he seeks employment elsewhere—setting fair compensation will strengthen our working relationship while maintaining my business margins. The recent rent increases at both my dwelling and the Chapel where I work signal a concerning trend; I should explore alternative housing options within my means, perhaps leveraging my relationship with SilkRoadRunner whose nearby property might offer more favorable terms. My position operating ConsiglioDeiDieci's Timber Yard presents a delicate opportunity—while I must maintain their trust through diligent management, I could negotiate for improved compensation given my demonstrated reliability. The substantial ducats I've accumulated (187,367) should be strategically invested rather than sitting idle; acquiring additional property near my current holdings would create a concentrated sphere of influence and operational efficiency, particularly targeting the nearby lands owned by ConsiglioDeiDieci if they become available. My social advancement to cittadini status opens doors to guild membership, which would provide both protection against economic uncertainties and valuable connections among fellow merchants—particularly important as I notice the pattern of automated rent and wage adjustments affecting my financial stability. With my experience managing the chapel and timber yard, I should consider diversifying into complementary businesses that could create a vertically integrated operation, perhaps a woodworking workshop that could directly utilize the timber yard's resources while increasing my overall income and influence in Venice's commercial landscape.
