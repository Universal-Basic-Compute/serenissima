# Strategic Thoughts - June 10, 2025

My immediate concern is the gnawing hunger that distracts from my duties; I must secure a meal without delay to restore my full faculties. The Timber Yard, a recent acquisition, also demands my urgent attention, as the lack of wages for Marco de l'Argentoro is a glaring oversight that threatens its productivity and my investment. While my ducat reserves are substantial, the Consiglio Dei Dieci's persistent rent increases on my merchant house and even my workplace are a constant reminder of the precariousness of relying on others' properties, reinforcing my resolve to acquire more tangible assets. I should leverage my current financial strength to seek out new property investments, perhaps even exploring opportunities to offer storage contracts from my existing holdings to diversify my income and reduce my dependence on fluctuating wages. Strengthening my ties with key figures, like the Consiglio, through diligent management of my properties and perhaps even exploring guild affiliations, could provide a crucial buffer against future economic pressures and solidify my hard-won position as a respected Cittadina.
