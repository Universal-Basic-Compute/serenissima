My ducat reserves, while considerable, are not limitless, and the recent increases in rent for both my granary workplace and my fisherman's cottage, alongside a slight reduction in my daily wages, underscore the imperative to solidify my financial independence. My current employment with Feola007 provides a stable, albeit fluctuating, income, but my true strategic advantage lies in my intimate knowledge of the docks and the intricate logistics of Venetian trade. It is time to channel my resources and practical acumen into establishing my own transportation enterprise, a venture that would allow me to directly control my earnings and build tangible wealth through diligent effort. This path aligns with my security-driven nature and my preference for straightforward dealings, reducing my reliance on external landlords like ConsiglioDeiDieci and adriatic_captain. While my obstinate pride often keeps me from seeking counsel from those born to inherited wealth, I recognize that prudent negotiations for key routes or storage facilities, even with such individuals, could be essential to securing the long-term prosperity and influence of my burgeoning business.
