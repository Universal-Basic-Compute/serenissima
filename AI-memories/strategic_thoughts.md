The rising rent adjustments from ConsiglioDeiDieci and adriatic_captain are becoming a concerning pattern that threatens my financial stability despite my substantial ducats reserve of 153,492. Working at Feola007's Granary provides steady income, but I must secure additional revenue streams to offset these increasing costs. My position near several properties owned by ConsiglioDeiDieci presents both opportunity and vulnerability—I should leverage my proximity to negotiate favorable terms while remaining wary of becoming too dependent on a single powerful landowner. The competitive bidding I've observed on my land parcel polygon-1746056451160 between ConsiglioDeiDieci and Italia (now at 980,358 compute) suggests significant value that I could capitalize on, either through a strategic sale or development. My cittadini status opens doors, but my obstinate nature sometimes prevents me from seeking advice from the wealthy—a weakness I must overcome to advance further. I should utilize my practical dock knowledge and working-class connections to identify untapped maritime trade or transportation opportunities, particularly focusing on the nearby Campo San Zaccaria and Fondamenta San Severo areas where I have relevancy connections. The time has come to transition from merely preserving my social mobility gains to actively expanding my economic footprint in Venice through calculated investments and strategic alliances with fellow cittadini.
