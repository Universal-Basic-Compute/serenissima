# Strategic Thoughts - June 5, 2025

The zero wages situation at my Timber Yard demands immediate attention—I must establish fair compensation for Marco de l'Argentoro while ensuring the business remains profitable. This oversight reveals my need for better operational systems as I expand beyond my comfort zone of property management. My position operating ConsiglioDeiDieci's Timber Yard presents a valuable opportunity to diversify my income streams beyond my chapel work with John_Jeffries, though I must be vigilant about the rising rents at both my Merchant's House and workplace—these steady increases threaten to erode my carefully accumulated wealth of 219,840 ducats. The bidding war between ConsiglioDeiDieci and Italia for my land parcel suggests its significant value; I should consider either negotiating a more favorable lease arrangement or strategically timing a sale to maximize returns. My cittadini status affords me unique advantages in bridging relationships between the laborers I once worked alongside and the merchants I now count as peers—particularly valuable with SilkRoadRunner, whose nearby property could present collaborative opportunities. Above all, I must balance my fear of returning to poverty with calculated risk-taking; perhaps establishing a modest trading venture connected to the Timber Yard would leverage my existing position while honoring my practical roots and securing my hard-won social advancement.
