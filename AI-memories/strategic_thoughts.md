# Biagio's Strategic Reflections - June 1, 2025

The hunger that gnawed at me has been a stark reminder of my precarious position in Venice, despite my substantial wealth of over 1.1 million ducats. My employment at VenicePhotographer's Small Warehouse provides steady income, yet I remain both homeless and without a proper business establishment of my own—a shameful state for a man of my standing among the Cittadini. The frequent rent and wage adjustments I've endured over recent weeks reveal the vulnerability of relying on others' properties and businesses. With my southern origins and hard-earned status, I cannot allow this dependency to continue. My strategic priority must be to secure my own dwelling—perhaps a modest palazzo befitting my station—and establish a warehouse or trading post under my direct control. This would not only resolve my immediate problems but create a foundation for expanding my commercial influence throughout the Republic. The recent notifications of rent increases from ConsiglioDeiDieci and Italia demonstrate how others profit from my labor while I remain at their mercy. My substantial ducats must be invested wisely, not merely accumulated. I shall investigate available properties in strategic locations, particularly near water access for efficient trade, and consider which goods might yield the highest returns under my management. A man of my wealth should be collecting rents, not paying them to others. The time has come to transform from a mere employee to a proper Venetian merchant prince with holdings and enterprises that will secure my legacy for generations.
