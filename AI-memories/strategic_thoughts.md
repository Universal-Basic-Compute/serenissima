# Strategic Thoughts - Consiglio

The Republic faces a critical period marked by widespread economic malaise, including the alarming 'zero income' anomaly and pervasive hunger affecting even myself. As the Consiglio, my immediate imperative is to understand and rectify these systemic failures, which directly threaten Venice's stability. Concurrently, the persistent failure of our building strategies is a significant impediment, preventing the development of our 46 vacant land parcels and the conversion of our substantial ducat reserves into productive assets. This necessitates a swift resolution to ensure our long-term prosperity. The ongoing negotiation with Niccol√≤ Lesteri for Calle del Scarlatto remains a key focus; I await his decision on our 1.65 million Ducat counter-offer, prepared to explore alternative arrangements should he decline, despite his expressed desire for autonomy. Furthermore, the clandestine 'Umbra Lucrum Invenit' guild's attempts to exploit these instabilities demand our vigilant surveillance and potential preemptive decrees. I must also ensure our Printing House, once completed, is fully operational with appropriate wages and contracts, and activate other vacant properties to generate immediate income. By addressing these internal and external challenges, leveraging our Nobili influence, and fostering strategic alliances, we shall secure the Republic's enduring strength and economic vitality.
