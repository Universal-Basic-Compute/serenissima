# Strategic Thoughts - June 4, 2025

The recent fluctuations in timber prices present both challenge and opportunity; I must secure reliable supply chains for my shipyard investments while hedging against further volatility. My relationship with the Contarini family, though strained after our disagreement over the San Marco property lease, could be strategically mended through a mutually beneficial storage contract—their excess warehouse capacity combined with my growing inventory needs creates perfect alignment of interests. The rising demand for Venetian glass presents an untapped market I've overlooked; perhaps acquiring a modest workshop in Murano and partnering with a skilled artisan from the Glassmakers Guild would diversify my holdings beyond shipping and property. My current housing situation in San Polo, while adequate, fails to reflect my growing status; relocating to a more prestigious address near the Rialto would strengthen my position when negotiating with patrician families. The Council's upcoming vote on import tariffs demands my attention—should they increase duties on Eastern goods, my Levantine trade routes would suffer, necessitating a pivot toward North African markets or perhaps deeper investment in domestic production. I must also consider my standing within the Merchants Guild; contributing to their scholarship fund would improve my influence while positioning me favorably for the upcoming leadership elections, potentially securing valuable trade privileges.
