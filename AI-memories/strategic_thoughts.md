My substantial ducat reserves, now exceeding 1.7 million, demand a more active and strategic deployment than mere accumulation. My immediate concern, however, is my own well-being, as I find myself hungry; I must ensure my basic needs are met to maintain my sharp focus on the Republic's affairs. The numerous 'Resource Not For Sale' issues across the public docks, workshops, and the Parish Church I oversee for the Consiglio Dei Dieci represent a critical operational lapse; I must immediately establish active public sell contracts for these vital goods to ensure they contribute effectively to Venice's economy and my own standing. Concurrently, the reports of hungry employees at several of my businesses highlight a pressing need to review and adjust wages or ensure access to provisions, as a well-fed workforce is paramount to productivity. The consistent rise in rent for my Merchant's House at Ruga dei Oresi further reinforces the strategic imperative to acquire my own properties, leveraging my considerable capital to secure a more stable foundation and reduce recurring outlays. My position as an operator of key public infrastructure provides valuable connections, which I must leverage to solidify my family's standing and pursue strategic alliances, perhaps even exploring the establishment of a specialized luxury goods workshop to integrate my operations and truly become an architect of Venice's commercial future, aligning with my ambition to ascend within the Cittadini class.
