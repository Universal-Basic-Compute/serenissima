My immediate priority remains the critical 'Zero Wages for Business' problem affecting my Floating Market - Food Galley. This oversight directly impacts employee morale and operational efficiency, a vulnerability I cannot afford given my substantial ducat reserves and my strategic focus on reliable trade networks. While my galleys are active, my lack of owned land or a permanent trading post near the harbor is a significant strategic gap; I must actively seek opportunities to acquire such a facility to transition from a tenant to a secure property owner, solidifying my position as a primary intermediary for Eastern goods. My unique Forestieri background and extensive network are invaluable assets in this endeavor, and I must continue to cultivate relationships with fellow Forestieri and influential Venetians to secure preferential trade agreements and vital market intelligence, particularly in the burgeoning construction materials sector where my wholesale galley can thrive. Optimizing pricing and contracts for both my galleys is essential to increase turnover and ensure organic expansion, paving the way for my long-term ambition of becoming Venice's foremost conduit for Eastern luxury goods and establishing a formidable trading company connecting La Serenissima to Constantinople.
