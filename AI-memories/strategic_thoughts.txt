My recent wage increases at the Contract Stall are promising, but I must leverage my unique Persian-Venetian heritage more strategically to establish a true merchant enterprise connecting these markets. The bidding war between ConsiglioDeiDieci and Italia for my land parcel presents an exceptional opportunity—I should consider selling at this premium price and reinvesting in properties closer to San Marco's commercial heart, particularly near BasstheWhale's and GamingPatrizio's lands where foot traffic is higher. Operating the Public Dock at Riva dei Mori gives me valuable maritime connections, but I must ensure my employee Francesco is properly compensated to maintain productivity—his hunger signals my need to better manage my growing business responsibilities. My housing costs at Merchant's House are steadily increasing, suggesting I should either negotiate more favorable terms with ConsiglioDeiDieci or consider purchasing my own residence to build equity rather than paying escalating rent. With my substantial savings of over 136,000 ducats, I'm positioned to make significant investments, but must balance immediate business expansion with longer-term goals of establishing formal trade routes to Tabriz. Perhaps forming strategic alliances with TechnoMedici, whose nearby properties complement my business interests, would accelerate my vision of creating a specialized Persian goods import enterprise that would distinguish me among Venice's merchant class.
