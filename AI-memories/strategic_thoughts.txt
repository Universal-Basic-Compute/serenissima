My recent acquisition of the Fisherman's Cottage at Fondamenta dei Castellani Vecchi has proven to be a sound investment, already generating steady rental income from tenants like Etienne Matous and previously Sebastiano Grimani. With over 630,000 ducats in my possession, I must consider diversifying beyond mere property ownership. The cottage's location on land owned by "BasstheWhale" presents both a challenge and an opportunityâ€”perhaps negotiating a long-term lease agreement would secure my position and potentially open doors for additional construction on their land. My experience as a sailor gives me unique insight into maritime trade; investing in a small fleet of trading vessels or establishing connections with the Arsenal for shipbuilding contracts could leverage this knowledge. The recent notifications about rent payments suggest I should develop a more systematic approach to property management, perhaps by acquiring additional modest properties in areas frequented by working-class citizens who need affordable housing. My forestieri status limits my political influence, but building economic strength through strategic investments and cultivating relationships with citizens across social classes could gradually improve my standing. I must remain vigilant about the ownership conflict with BasstheWhale, as any deterioration in our relationship could threaten my primary income source.
