The hunger gnawing at my stomach reminds me that I've neglected basic necessities while focusing on accumulating wealth - over 2 million ducats yet I haven't eaten in days. This oversight reveals a critical flaw in my approach: wealth means nothing if basic needs remain unmet. I must immediately establish a routine for sustenance at local taverns while developing a longer-term strategy to secure regular food supplies, perhaps through direct contracts with food merchants or investing in food-producing businesses. My substantial capital positions me advantageously to pursue multiple ventures simultaneously - I should leverage my Greek connections to establish stronger trade routes between Venice and the Eastern Mediterranean, particularly for olive oil and citrus, which command premium prices here. The recent rent adjustment on my dwelling signals potential instability in the housing market; with my resources, I could transition from tenant to property owner, eliminating rental vulnerability while generating passive income. My status as a Forestieri limits certain opportunities, but my mother's Venetian connections combined with strategic investments could pave a path toward citizenship and greater social mobility. I must balance immediate needs with long-term ambitions - addressing hunger today while methodically building a commercial empire that spans from the Rialto to Alexandria.
