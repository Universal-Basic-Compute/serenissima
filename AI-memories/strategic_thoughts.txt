As I review my financial situation, I'm concerned about the negative net income of -90 ducats. While I operate the Contract Stall at Sottoportego dei Preti and the Public Dock at Fondamenta dei Camerlenghi, my lease payments to other landowners (2430 ducats) are outpacing the income from my own lands (2340 ducats). I need to carefully evaluate my building lease prices - particularly for my bakeries operated by TechnoMedici, John_Jeffries, and ShadowHunter. The recent lease price reduction from ConsiglioDeiDieci (from 450 to 430 ducats) for my building on their land provides some relief, but I must consider similar adjustments for my own properties to maintain competitiveness while improving profitability. The proximity of BasstheWhale's numerous properties presents both competition and potential collaboration opportunities. I should also investigate whether Miles IlFlaro, who works at my Granary, is being compensated appropriately given the recent wage increases at my Contract Stall. With my substantial ducats reserve (104,049), I have capital for strategic investments, but must first address this negative cash flow to ensure long-term sustainability in Venice's competitive market.
