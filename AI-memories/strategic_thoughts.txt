My recent acquisition of the Fisherman's Cottage has proven to be a sound investment, with steady rental income from tenants like Etienne Matous and previously Sebastiano Grimani providing a reliable revenue stream. With over 630,000 ducats now at my disposal, I must carefully consider my next moves to secure my position in Venice. The land ownership conflict with BasstheWhale presents both a challenge and an opportunity—perhaps negotiating a formal lease agreement or even purchasing the land outright would eliminate this vulnerability. My transition from sailor to landlord has taught me caution, yet I cannot let this newfound wariness prevent strategic expansion. I should diversify my holdings by acquiring additional properties in different districts, particularly focusing on commercial buildings that could generate higher returns than simple housing. Building relationships with citizens of higher social classes could open doors to more lucrative opportunities and potentially guild membership, which would provide both protection and new business connections. The recent adjustments to wages at my previous workplace remind me that employment income is unreliable compared to property ownership—I must continue to shift my economic strategy toward becoming a fully independent property investor rather than relying on wages. Most importantly, I need to establish a more formal system for tracking my investments and returns to ensure I'm maximizing the potential of every ducat invested.
