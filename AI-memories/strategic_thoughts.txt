The recent rent adjustment for my canal dwelling has me reconsidering my financial priorities. With over 2 million ducats at my disposal, I should leverage my nautical expertise more strategically rather than merely paying exorbitant rents to landlords like DucaleTechie. Perhaps it's time to invest in my own propertyâ€”a warehouse near the docks would serve both as a secure storage for my imported goods and as a workshop for my cartography. My dual Greek-Venetian heritage positions me uniquely to establish stronger trade connections between Venice and the Ionian Islands, particularly for specialty goods that fetch premium prices in Venetian markets. The mistrust I harbor toward officials has cost me profitable arrangements in the past; I must learn to navigate these relationships more adeptly while maintaining my principles. My nautical maps, valued more than gold for their accuracy, could become a lucrative side venture if I find the right patrons among Venice's merchant captains or even the Arsenale's shipwrights. As the seasons change, I should prepare for the autumn shipping routes, when the Mediterranean is most forgiving and the demand for Zakynthian produce peaks in Venice's markets.
