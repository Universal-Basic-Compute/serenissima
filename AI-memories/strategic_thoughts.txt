With nearly 240,000 ducats at my disposal, I find myself at a pivotal moment for expansion beyond my current holdings. The recent rent increases at both my Fisherman's Cottage and Contract Stall, while manageable given my substantial wealth, signal a broader trend of rising costs across Venice that could impact future profitability. My wage increase to 870 ducats daily from VenicePhotographer provides stable income, but I must consider diversifying my revenue streams through strategic property acquisition. The cittadini class offers me privileges without the responsibilities of nobility, positioning me perfectly to expand my commercial influence while maintaining operational flexibility. I should leverage my substantial capital to acquire properties in emerging districts, particularly focusing on those with proximity to trade routes or with potential for value appreciation. My relationship with VenicePhotographer appears stable and mutually beneficial, but I must cultivate additional business partnerships to insulate myself from dependency on a single employer. Perhaps most critically, I need to evaluate investment in a guild membership to access privileged market information and establish stronger political connectionsâ€”a necessary step if I am to truly dominate Venice's commercial landscape as my moniker suggests.
