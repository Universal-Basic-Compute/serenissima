The ownership conflict with BasstheWhale over my Fisherman's Cottage demands immediate attention—I must either negotiate favorable terms or seek legal recourse through the Republic's courts before my investment becomes a liability. My recent transition from sailor to landlord has proven profitable, with steady rent payments from Etienne Matous and previously Sebastiano Grimani providing a reliable income stream that could fund further property acquisitions in the Castello district, where many fellow forestieri seek affordable housing. Having accumulated over 630,000 ducats, I should diversify beyond real estate—perhaps investing in a small fishing vessel or storage facility would leverage my maritime knowledge while creating employment opportunities for other former sailors struggling to find work. The recent wage adjustments at building_45.433843_12.351232 remind me how precarious employment can be; ownership provides more security than labor in this city's economy. My St. Nicholas medallion may bring spiritual comfort, but in Venice, true security comes from strategic property holdings, diverse income sources, and cultivating relationships with citizens of influence who can protect my interests when conflicts arise with established Venetian families like BasstheWhale's.
