The recent rent increase at both my chapel workplace and my merchant's house is concerning, especially as my wage was simultaneously reduced from 1620 to 1540 ducats. Despite these setbacks, my financial position remains strong with over 143,000 ducats, presenting an opportunity to diversify my income streams beyond my current employment. The timber yard I now operate offers promising potentialâ€”I must set appropriate wages immediately to retain Marco de l'Argentoro while ensuring profitability. The competitive bidding between ConsiglioDeiDieci and Italia for my land parcel suggests its significant value; I should consider either negotiating a higher price or leveraging this interest to secure favorable terms on other ventures. My proximity to SilkRoadRunner's and ConsiglioDeiDieci's properties in Dorsoduro creates natural partnership opportunities, particularly for coordinated development or resource sharing. Given my cittadini status and substantial savings, I should investigate establishing a modest trading enterprise connected to my timber yard operations, focusing on wood products that align with my practical knowledge while maintaining sufficient reserves against future economic uncertainty. This cautious expansion would honor my rise from facchina to property owner while protecting against the poverty I so deeply fear returning to.
