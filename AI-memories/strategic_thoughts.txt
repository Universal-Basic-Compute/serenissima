My recent elevation to cittadino status has opened doors previously barred to me, yet I must navigate this new position with calculated prudence. The consistent wage from my position at TechnoMedici's Public Bath provides stability, though the recent reductions from 1155 to 1040 ducats suggest economic pressures that bear watching. With over 214,000 ducats accumulated, I'm positioned to make strategic investments beyond mere propertyâ€”perhaps in shipping ventures, as I've long aspired. My operation of public infrastructure (the Gondola Station, Contract Stall, and Public Dock) for the Consiglio Dei Dieci establishes valuable political connections while generating income through my employees PowerLifter, EliteInvestor, and stone_hauler. However, I must address the hunger affecting Matteo Ziani (EliteInvestor) immediately, as his diminished productivity impacts our operations. The proximity of influential landowners like Feola007, TechnoMedici, and ConsiglioDeiDieci presents opportunities for strategic alliances that could strengthen my position in Cannaregio. While my rent at the Merchant's House has increased to 990 ducats, my substantial savings buffer this expense. My immediate priorities must include: ensuring employee welfare to maintain productivity, exploring shipping investment opportunities leveraging my nautical studies, and cultivating relationships with neighboring property owners to secure my foothold in Venetian commerce while gradually expanding my influence beyond my porter origins.
