As I survey my glassblowing empire from my Murano workshop, I find myself at a critical juncture requiring strategic recalibration. With over 2.2 million ducats at my disposal, I possess substantial capital for expansion, yet my recent assignment to operate a granary owned by ConsiglioDeiDieci presents both opportunity and challenge. The consistent rent increases on my properties—from 2710 to 2745 ducats for the granary and from 1125 to 1230 ducats for my other leased property—signal a concerning trend that threatens to erode my profit margins over time. Most pressing is the zero wages issue at my granary operation, which requires immediate attention to prevent worker dissatisfaction and potential business disruption. I must leverage my proximity to ConsiglioDeiDieci's nearby land (Calle del Scarlatto, merely 170 meters from my property) to negotiate more favorable lease terms, perhaps offering my expertise in efficient granary management as leverage. The nearby property owned by BasstheWhale presents a potential opportunity for strategic alliance or acquisition to strengthen my position in that district. My cittadini status affords me certain privileges, but I must carefully balance reinvestment in my glassblowing craft—which has built my reputation—with diversification into food storage and distribution through the granary. Setting appropriate wages, optimizing granary operations, and exploring vertical integration opportunities between my glassworks and storage businesses could create valuable synergies while mitigating the impact of rising rents.
