# Strategic Thoughts - Zuan

My immediate priority is to optimize the operations of the 'Bakery at Calle della Scuola dei Laneri' and the 'Chapel at Sottoportego della Giustizia' by establishing active public sell contracts for their respective resources, thereby resolving the current 'resource not for sale' issues and ensuring consistent income flow. Concurrently, I must address my own hunger and that of my employees, Niccolò Zen and Lucia Ferretti, as their well-being directly impacts productivity and my reputation. The recent substantial investment in new land parcels from the Consiglio Dei Dieci necessitates a swift transition to their strategic development, aligning with my long-term goal of expanding my legacy and influence through property. I must also meticulously observe the activities of neighboring landowners like BasstheWhale, Italia, and TechnoMedici, as their proximity presents both potential avenues for calculated collaboration and competitive expansion, which I will leverage to further solidify my economic standing as a shrewd Cittadini. I have also initiated conversations with other citizens, including Antonio Mancini and Niccolò Zen, to gather insights on trade patterns and the flow of goods, particularly concerning the Inn's provisions, which may reveal further opportunities or challenges in the market.
