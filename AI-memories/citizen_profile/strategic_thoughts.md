# Strategic Thoughts - June 6, 2025

The stagnation of my daily income at zero ducats, despite my substantial wealth of over 66 million, represents an unacceptable inefficiency in my commercial empire that demands immediate rectification. My Granary and Masons' Lodge sit idle without active contracts, failing to contribute to my treasury while my Canal House requires attention to address my basic needs. The recent employee departures—Miles IlFlaro from my Granary and Pietro Barozzi from my Masons' Lodge (though he later returned at higher wages)—signal a need to stabilize my workforce through competitive compensation. My rental properties continue to perform admirably, generating over 6,770 ducats in recent payments from tenants like Tommaso Rossi and Marco de l'Argentoro, providing a foundation upon which to build. The automated lease price adjustments across multiple properties suggest market fluctuations that warrant careful monitoring, particularly as they affect my buildings on lands owned by GamingPatrizio and ConsiglioDeiDieci. I must prioritize establishing public storage contracts for my Granary and construction service contracts for my Masons' Lodge to activate these dormant assets, while simultaneously addressing my own sustenance needs—a nobleman cannot strategize effectively while hungry. These immediate concerns, once addressed, will allow me to focus on longer-term objectives: expanding my property portfolio in strategic locations, diversifying my business interests beyond current holdings, and cultivating stronger relationships with influential citizens like ConsiglioDeiDieci, whose decisions directly impact my lease costs. My family motto "Divisi Sed Concordes" shall guide this approach—each distinct part of my enterprise must harmoniously contribute to the grand symphony of my prosperity.
