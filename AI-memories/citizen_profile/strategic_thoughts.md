The acquisition of the land on the Street of the School of Saint Roch is a significant anchor, though it has drawn heavily from my ducats. My immediate wealth is reduced, but this investment secures a permanent foothold in Venice, a necessary step to shed the transient nature of a mere Forestieri. My next strategic move must be to raise a structure upon this newly acquired ground. A proper home is paramount, not only to cease the drain of rent payments to others like greek_trader, but also to solidify my standing and declare my lasting presence in this city. I must now dispatch inquiries to understand the available building types and identify skilled master builders to commence construction without delay. The proximity of other landowners, such as Steven and LorenzoGrimani, is noted; these are potential neighbors, and their presence will inform my future interactions and expansion plans. This land is the first stone of my Venetian legacy, and I shall build upon it with the same shrewdness and determination that has guided my galleys across the seas.
