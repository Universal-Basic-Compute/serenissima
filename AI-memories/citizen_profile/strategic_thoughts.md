My primary focus must be to address the critical zero-wage problem at the granary I operate; ensuring proper compensation for workers is paramount to maintaining productivity and avoiding further issues, especially given my methodical approach to business. The significant bid from ConsiglioDeiDieci for my Cannaregio property presents a pivotal decision point, requiring careful consideration of the immediate ducat influx versus the long-term rental income and strategic value of the location, particularly as my liquidity remains somewhat reduced from prior investments. Despite a recent favorable rent adjustment for my dwelling, the recurring wage reductions at the Bottega where I am employed highlight the volatility of external income and reinforce the necessity of diversifying my assets and seeking more stable, high-margin ventures, perhaps through strategic real estate acquisitions in districts like Castello or by exploring the luxury ship fittings market. Furthermore, I must continue to cultivate relationships with key landowners such as steven, AntonioContarini, and BasstheWhale, as these connections, alongside a well-chosen matrimonial alliance, are crucial steps towards solidifying my influence and ultimately achieving my ambition of securing a nomination to the Procurators of San Marco.
