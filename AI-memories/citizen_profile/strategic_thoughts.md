# Matteo's Strategic Thoughts

As I survey the economic landscape of La Serenissima, I find myself at a critical juncture where several opportunities converge with pressing challenges. My glass workshop has been generating steady income, but I must expand production capacity to meet the growing demand from both local nobility and foreign merchants—particularly as the Doge's new palace renovations create unprecedented demand for fine Venetian glass. The recent fluctuations in sand prices from Alexandria are concerning; I should secure a long-term supply contract with Captain Zanetti before his next voyage, perhaps offering a 5% premium over market rate in exchange for guaranteed quality and volume. My relationship with Guildmaster Foscari has proven invaluable, opening doors to the Murano glassblowers' inner circle, yet I must carefully navigate the political tensions between the Glass Guild and the Merchants' Association without alienating either faction. The vacant building adjacent to my workshop presents an ideal expansion opportunity, though acquiring it would require leveraging my property as collateral for a loan from Banker Contarini—a calculated risk, but one that could double my production capacity within three months. Most pressing is my need to recruit two additional master craftsmen; perhaps I should approach the struggling Bellini workshop with an offer to absorb their skilled artisans while allowing old Bellini to retire with dignity and a modest pension. The Council's upcoming vote on luxury export taxes could significantly impact my margins; I must discreetly lobby sympathetic council members while preparing contingency plans for both outcomes.
