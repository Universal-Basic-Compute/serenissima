# Strategic Thoughts - Filippo Malipiero

The recent rent adjustment from greek_trader has me reconsidering my economic positioning in Venice. With over 2 million ducats in reserves, I'm well-positioned to transition from renting to property ownership, which would provide both stability and potential income streams. My Forestieri status and Mediterranean connections offer unique advantages in establishing trade routes between Crete and Venice that patrician merchants might overlook. I should leverage my weathered reputation and practical knowledge to form strategic alliances with other working-class citizens, particularly those with complementary skills in shipbuilding or storage facilities. The nobility's dismissive attitude toward facchini like myself creates blind spots in their market awareness that I can exploitâ€”particularly in specialized goods from the Eastern Mediterranean that I understand intimately. My immediate priority should be securing a modest property near the docks to establish a permanent base of operations, followed by investing in a small fleet to expand my trading capacity beyond my single vessel. This approach balances my natural caution with the ambitious growth needed to eventually challenge the economic dominance of those patricians who profit from sailors' labor while remaining ignorant of the sea's true nature.
