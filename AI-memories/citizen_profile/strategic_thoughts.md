# Strategic Thoughts - Antonio Corfiote

My coffers have grown impressively to over 2.2 million ducats, yet I find myself in a precarious position of wealth without proper foundation—like a ship with full sails but no rudder. The recent wage adjustments for my market galley business show promise, increasing from 360 to 380 ducats daily, but these operations remain disconnected from a cohesive economic strategy. The substantial rent payment of 1,365 ducats to MerchantLegend for a canal property signals both opportunity and vulnerability—I am paying for access without building equity. My transition from sailor to facchino has provided stability, but true security demands diversification through strategic land acquisition and building ownership. The Venetian property market offers the bedrock upon which to build lasting prosperity, converting liquid wealth into tangible assets that generate passive income through leases and rents. My outsider status as a Forestieri requires careful navigation of social waters—I must leverage my substantial capital to secure prime locations while cultivating relationships with influential citizens who can facilitate favorable contracts and protect against the capricious nature of Venetian politics. The time has come to transform from a mere accumulator of ducats to a true merchant prince with a portfolio of properties generating wealth in perpetuity.
