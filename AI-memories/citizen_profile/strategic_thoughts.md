My immediate priority is to address my gnawing hunger, for a clear mind is essential to navigate Venice's treacherous economic waters. Concurrently, the oversight of Marco de l'Argentoro's wages at the Timber Yard demands swift rectification; his satisfaction is paramount to the stability and productivity of this nascent venture, which I intend to cultivate into a cornerstone of my independent wealth. My substantial ducat reserves, currently lying fallow, must be put to work without delay, especially given the concerning decline in my Chapel wages and the relentless increases in rent from ConsiglioDeiDieci, which threaten to erode my hard-won prosperity. The ongoing competition for my land parcel is a fortunate development, and I shall patiently observe the bidding war between ConsiglioDeiDieci and Italia to ensure I extract the maximum possible value. The capital thus secured will be prudently reinvested into strategic properties, particularly those that complement my existing holdings or the Timber Yard, and, crucially, will fund the establishment of my own independent trading venture in wood and construction materials, leveraging Marco's expertise and my growing understanding of the market. I must also consider how to stabilize my relationship with ConsiglioDeiDieci, my primary landlord, and explore new, more profitable alliances within Venice's intricate economic web to secure my long-term prosperity and influence, always vigilant against any threat to my hard-earned position.
