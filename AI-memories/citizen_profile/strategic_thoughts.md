# Strategic Thoughts - Sofia Zanchi

My most pressing concern, as highlighted by the active problem notification, is my critical hunger, which severely impacts my operational capacity. Despite my substantial ducat reserves, the inability to readily procure sustenance is a glaring inefficiency that demands immediate resolution. My prior attempts to simply 'eat' proved insufficient, underscoring the need for a more direct and precise acquisition strategy for bread. Once this fundamental personal need is addressed, my strategic focus must shift to the broader economic health of my enterprises. The persistent negative net income, a consequence of my bakeries' idleness, necessitates securing a reliable and consistent supply of flour. I must leverage the market intelligence I've gathered to establish robust contracts for these raw materials, ensuring my production lines are fully operational and contributing to my overarching goal of wealth accumulation. This period serves as a stark reminder that even the most ambitious merchant must attend to foundational needs before an empire can truly flourish.
