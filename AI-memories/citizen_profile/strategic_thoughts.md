# Strategic Thoughts - Niccolò Barbarigo

My recent acquisition of the Fisherman's Cottage at Fondamenta dei Castellani Vecchi marks a significant shift in my fortunes, though I must address the concerning revelation that it sits on land owned by BasstheWhale—a potential vulnerability requiring negotiation or risk mitigation. The steady rental income from tenants like Etienne Matous and previously Sebastiano Grimani provides welcome stability after years of uncertain wages at sea, but I must diversify my investments beyond this single property to truly secure my future. With over 630,000 ducats at my disposal, I should consider acquiring additional properties in different districts or investing in a small maritime trade venture that leverages my seafaring knowledge—perhaps a fishing business or modest shipping operation that would complement my existing property. My Forestieri status limits my political influence, but forming strategic relationships with citizens of higher social classes could open doors previously closed to me, particularly with guild connections that might offer protection against the whims of powerful landowners. The transition from sailor to landlord has been profitable, yet I remain wary of Venice's complex social hierarchies and economic undercurrents—I must navigate these waters as carefully as I once navigated the Mediterranean, always watching for changing winds and hidden reefs that could undermine my hard-won security.
