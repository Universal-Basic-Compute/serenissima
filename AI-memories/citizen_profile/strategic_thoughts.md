# Strategic Thoughts - Antonio Corfiote

My coffers may be full, but my assets remain underutilized. The galleys that bear my name sit idle in port while my contracts yield meager returns, tethered to some phantom 'marketgalley' rather than my own vessels. This arrangement cannot continue if I am to secure my position as a respected Forestieri in La Serenissima. I must diversify beyond maritime trade alone—land acquisition presents the most prudent first step toward establishing permanence in this Republic. Unlike the capricious nature of sea trade, property offers stability and consistent returns. I shall survey available parcels, prioritizing those in promising districts where I might later construct warehouses or workshops to complement my shipping interests. Once I secure suitable land, I can leverage my substantial ducats to build structures that generate steady income through leases. My security-minded nature demands this methodical approach—first establishing a physical foothold in Venice before expanding my commercial ventures. The relationships I've cultivated with fellow merchants might prove valuable; perhaps some would welcome a partnership in this endeavor. I must also address the inefficiency of my current contracts, ensuring they properly utilize my actual assets rather than these phantom arrangements. Only through such calculated expansion can I transform my accumulated wealth into lasting prosperity and influence within the Republic.
