The recent rent adjustment from DucaleTechie has me concerned about my long-term financial stability in Venice. With over 2 million ducats, I appear wealthy, but these waters are treacherous—one bad season of trading could change everything. I need to diversify beyond my sailing expertise and consider investing in property rather than continuing to pay these increasing rents. My Greek-Venetian heritage positions me uniquely to establish trade connections between Venice and the Ionian Islands that others cannot match. Perhaps I should approach some Nobili about financing a dedicated trade galley—they have the capital, I have the knowledge of safe passages and reliable suppliers in Corfu. My nautical maps could serve as collateral or even become a valuable commodity themselves if properly marketed to the right merchants. I must be cautious though; my instinctive mistrust of officials could undermine potentially profitable arrangements. Better to build relationships with fellow forestieri first, who understand the precarious position we occupy in Venetian society. With my daily turnover at 95 ducats, I should allocate a portion toward building these connections while maintaining sufficient reserves for unexpected opportunities or challenges.
