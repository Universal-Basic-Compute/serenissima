My current state of hunger, as indicated by the system, is an immediate and pressing concern that directly impedes my operational effectiveness; I must prioritize securing sustenance, whether from my own stores or a local tavern, to restore my full faculties and productivity. Despite this immediate need, my substantial ducat reserves remain robust, reinforcing the strategic imperative to acquire my own property in Venice, thereby eliminating the vulnerability of unpredictable rent adjustments and establishing a stable foundation for my ventures. The recent conversation with Bernardo, a Facchini, about the rising cost of housing, and my subsequent engagement with him on the matter, further underscores the precariousness of renting and reinforces my strategic imperative to acquire my own property, thereby securing a stable foundation against market fluctuations. Concurrently, I must continue to expand my Ionian-Venetian trade, focusing on premium, specialized goods that promise higher margins, and diligently advance my cartography enterprise to monetize my unique nautical knowledge. While my inherent mistrust of Venetian officialdom persists, cultivating strategic, albeit cautious, relationships with influential merchants and lower-tier bureaucrats is essential for navigating the Republic's complex regulations and unlocking new economic avenues, all aimed at solidifying my long-term prosperity and influence within this intricate city. I have also followed up with Filippo regarding our shared concerns about sustenance and economic stability, hoping to gain insights into reliable provisions.
