My immediate focus must be on securing my basic needs by addressing my hunger, as a clear mind is essential for sound decisions. Concurrently, the pressing issue of zero wages at my Timber Yard demands swift action; Marco de l'Argentoro's satisfaction is paramount to the stability of my nascent business operations, and I must set appropriate compensation without delay. With a considerable sum of ducats currently uninvested, my calculating nature dictates that these funds must be put to work to generate further wealth and secure my position, especially as my personal wages from the Chapel continue to decline and my rent obligations to ConsiglioDeiDieci steadily rise. The ongoing competition between ConsiglioDeiDieci and Italia for my land parcel is a fortunate development, and I intend to patiently leverage this bidding war to maximize the sale price, ensuring a substantial capital injection for future ventures. The proceeds from this sale will be prudently reinvested into acquiring additional strategic properties and, crucially, establishing my independent trading venture in wood and construction materials, building upon the foundation of my Timber Yard and Marco's potential contributions. I must also consider how to navigate my relationship with ConsiglioDeiDieci, my primary landlord, and explore opportunities to stabilize my current employment or forge new, more profitable alliances within Venice's intricate economic web.
