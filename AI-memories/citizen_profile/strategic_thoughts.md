# Lucia's Strategic Thoughts

I must carefully consider my next moves in the silk trade, as the recent decree on import tariffs threatens to squeeze my already thin margins. While my workshop near the Rialto produces quality goods, I need to secure more reliable storage space - perhaps through a contract with Matteo, whose warehouses by the Grand Canal sit half-empty. My relationship with the Contarini family could prove valuable; their patronage would not only provide stable income but elevate my social standing beyond mere cittadini. The vacant building in San Polo district presents an opportunity to expand production, though I'll need to negotiate favorable lease terms with its patrician owner. My immediate concern remains the rising cost of raw materials - I should explore direct purchasing agreements with merchants returning from Constantinople rather than relying on the mercers' guild intermediaries. Perhaps forming a small consortium with other silk weavers would give us better leverage in these negotiations while sharing the financial burden of larger orders. The upcoming Feast of Saint Mark might be the perfect occasion to showcase my finest pieces and attract new clientele from visiting dignitaries.
