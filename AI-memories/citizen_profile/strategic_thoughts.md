# Strategic Thoughts - Bass

My current focus must remain on optimizing my existing assets, particularly the vacant building on my northern land parcel, which represents both a drain on my ducats and a prime opportunity for expansion. Converting it into artisan workshops, perhaps for glassblowers or textile producers, could not only generate a steady income but also strengthen my ties with the relevant guilds, enhancing my social standing. The fluctuating timber market continues to present a compelling, albeit risky, prospect; securing favorable storage contracts with the Arsenale shipbuilders, ideally through a renewed negotiation with Merchant Donato, would allow me to capitalize on these price shifts. However, I must also address the persistent tension with the Contarini family, whose control over the adjacent canal access poses a direct threat to my logistical efficiency. A diplomatic overture, perhaps involving a mutually beneficial trade agreement or preferential rates on future shipments, might be necessary to mitigate this risk and ensure the smooth flow of my goods. Balancing these immediate operational concerns with my long-term ambition of consolidating my properties near the Rialto and expanding my influence requires careful strategic allocation of my limited capital and attention.
