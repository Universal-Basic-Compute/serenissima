# Lorenzo's Strategic Thoughts

The recent fluctuations in timber prices present both a challenge and opportunity for my shipbuilding investments. I must secure reliable supply chains by negotiating long-term contracts with the timber merchants from the mainland, perhaps leveraging my relationship with Giulia Contarini whose family controls several forest estates near Treviso. My financial reserves have grown steadily, but remain insufficient for the ambitious expansion into the spice trade I've been contemplating—establishing a direct trading post in Alexandria would require significant capital that I currently lack. Perhaps forming a temporary partnership with Marco Venier would be prudent; his connections with the Mamluk authorities would ease bureaucratic hurdles, though I must be cautious about the terms to avoid ceding too much control. The vacant warehouse in the Castello district presents an immediate opportunity—acquiring it before others recognize its value would secure storage for my growing inventory and potentially serve as collateral for future loans. I should also address the growing tension with the Silk Weavers Guild; their recent decree proposal could significantly increase my production costs if passed. I need to either lobby against it through my connections in the Council of Ten or adapt my business model to incorporate higher-quality local silk rather than imported varieties. Above all, I must carefully balance immediate profit opportunities against long-term investments in reputation and political influence—true wealth in Venice flows from both gold and connections.
