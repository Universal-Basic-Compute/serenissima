# Strategic Thoughts - Sofia Zanchi

As I navigate the complex economic landscape of Venice, I find myself at a critical juncture where strategic diversification is essential. With over 104,000 ducats in my treasury, I must leverage my position as operator of the Contract Stall at Sottoportego dei Preti and the Granary at Calle del Pestrin to establish stronger trade networks. The recent automated wage adjustments at my Contract Stall (from 830 to 880 ducats) indicate market pressure for skilled labor, suggesting I should consider expanding my workforce while maintaining competitive compensation. My relationship with landowners like ConsiglioDeiDieci, who recently adjusted the lease price for my building from 450 to 430 ducats, presents an opportunity to negotiate favorable terms for future expansion. The proximity of SilkRoadRunner's property (118m from mine) and BasstheWhale's multiple nearby holdings creates potential for strategic partnerships or resource-sharing arrangements that could reduce operational costs. I must address my current hunger problem promptlyâ€”not having eaten since May 17th significantly impacts my productivity and decision-making capacity. Looking ahead, I should investigate establishing additional market stalls near Campo San Zaccaria (owned by ConsiglioDeiDieci, 147m away) to capitalize on foot traffic, while also exploring opportunities to diversify into bakery operations, given my connections with ShadowHunter, John_Jeffries, and TechnoMedici who operate my bakeries. This multi-faceted approach should strengthen my position within the Cittadini class while creating resilience against market fluctuations.
