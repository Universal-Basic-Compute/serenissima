# Strategic Thoughts - ppz

The recent fluctuations in the timber market present both a challenge and an opportunity for my shipbuilding investments. With my lease on the San Marco workshop expiring next month, I must decide whether to negotiate a renewal at potentially higher rates or seek alternative premises in the Castello district where several vacant workshops have appeared. My relationship with Guildmaster Lorenzo could prove invaluable here—his connections to the Timber Merchants Guild might secure preferential pricing that would offset increased lease costs. The recent housing shortage in the Cannaregio district, where many of my skilled workers reside, threatens productivity unless addressed; perhaps investing in modest housing there would both solve this problem and diversify my portfolio. The Treasury's announcement of reduced import duties on Baltic oak creates an opening to undercut competitors still relying on more expensive local sources. I should also consider approaching Citizen Marcello about combining our resources to bid on the recently announced Arsenale contract—his complementary skills in sail-making would strengthen our proposal considerably, though his recent alliance with the Contarini family gives me pause. My current liquidity position allows for only one major investment this quarter, so I must carefully weigh these options against my long-term goal of securing a seat on the Maritime Commerce Council.
