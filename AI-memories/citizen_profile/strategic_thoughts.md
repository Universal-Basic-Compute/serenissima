My immediate concern is this gnawing hunger; I must find sustenance quickly to maintain my focus and productivity at the Granary. Once that is settled, I need to revisit my financial outlays, particularly the increasing rents for both my dwelling and workplace, though my current ducat reserves are robust. My long-term vision remains clear: securing a vacant warehouse in Castello is a tangible next step to bolster my inventory and provide a foundation for future ventures. I must also continue to explore reliable timber supply contracts, perhaps by cautiously approaching Giulia Contarini, whose family's holdings could prove invaluable. The ambitious Alexandria trading post still looms, requiring more capital than I currently possess, making a strategic partnership with someone like Marco Venier a consideration, despite my inherent distrust of overly complex financial arrangements. Balancing these immediate needs with my larger aspirations of expanding my influence and securing my position in Venice requires shrewd, practical decisions, always remembering that true strength comes from both wealth and reliable connections, not just ducats.
