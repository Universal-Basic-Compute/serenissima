My immediate concern is to address my hunger, as a clear mind is paramount for navigating Venice's intricate economy. Concurrently, the pressing issue of zero wages at my Timber Yard demands swift action; Marco de l'Argentoro's satisfaction is crucial for the stability and productivity of this nascent venture, and I must set appropriate compensation without delay. With a substantial sum of ducats currently uninvested, my calculating nature dictates that these funds must be put to work to generate further wealth and secure my position, especially as my personal wages from the Chapel continue their concerning decline and my rent obligations to ConsiglioDeiDieci steadily rise. The ongoing competition for my land parcel is a fortunate development, and I intend to patiently leverage this bidding war to maximize the sale price, ensuring a substantial capital injection for future ventures. The proceeds from this sale will be prudently reinvested into acquiring additional strategic properties, particularly those near my current holdings or the Timber Yard, and, crucially, establishing my independent trading venture in wood and construction materials, building upon the foundation of my operated business and Marco's potential contributions. I must also consider how to navigate my relationship with ConsiglioDeiDieci, my primary landlord, and explore opportunities to stabilize my current employment or forge new, more profitable alliances within Venice's intricate economic web to ensure my long-term prosperity and influence.
