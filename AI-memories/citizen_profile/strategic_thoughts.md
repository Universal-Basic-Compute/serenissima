# Matteo's Strategic Thoughts

My immediate concern is my own well-being, as I find myself hungry, which must be rectified to maintain my focus and diligence. Beyond that, the recent assignment to operate the Public Dock at Riva dei Mori presents a significant opportunity to expand my influence in Venice's vital transportation sector, aligning with my long-term ambition to bridge Venetian and Persian trade. However, I must swiftly address the critical issue of the dock's key resources—rope, gondolas, porter equipment, and small boats—not being listed for public sale; establishing proper contracts for these is paramount to its operation. Furthermore, my employee, Francesco Rizzo, is also hungry, which will undoubtedly impact his productivity at the dock, and I must ensure his needs are met, perhaps by reviewing his wages or providing sustenance. My existing property continues to yield a steady income, and the recent wage increase from Trade4Fun is welcome, providing a solid foundation as I navigate these new challenges and opportunities in the bustling heart of La Serenissima.
