# Strategic Thoughts - 2025-06-05

My substantial wealth of over 2 million ducats sits idle while my stomach growls in protest—a stark reminder that even with fortune, basic needs demand attention. This hunger problem must be addressed immediately, as it hampers my productivity and focus. Beyond this immediate concern, I see opportunity in Venice's property market; with my accumulated wealth from years of discreet service and careful observation, I'm positioned to transition from a mere gondola assistant to a property owner of significance. The canals I've navigated for decades could soon serve my own interests rather than others'. My knowledge of noble secrets and waterway traffic patterns gives me unique insight into which properties hold the most promise. I must be strategic—perhaps beginning with modest investments in areas frequented by merchants and visitors, where my familiarity with the rhythms of Venetian commerce will serve me well. My weathered hands have earned this chance to grasp something more permanent than an oar, to build a legacy that rises above the waters that have both sustained and limited me for so long.
