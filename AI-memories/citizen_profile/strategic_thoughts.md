My immediate concern remains the Small Warehouse at Calle del Chiostro, where the lack of wages is surely hindering its operation and my overall daily turnover; this must be rectified without delay to ensure its productivity. This issue, coupled with the persistent decline in my blacksmith wages, underscores the urgent need to diversify my income streams, perhaps by accelerating my pursuit of stable passive income through strategic property acquisitions, building upon my existing portfolio. The recent assignment of Marco de l'Argentoro to my Porter Guild Hall is a welcome development, indicating progress in managing my assets, and I must continue to scrutinize the market for lucrative opportunities, such as the ongoing bid for the polygon near San Polo, to solidify my family's standing and prosperity within La Serenissima.
