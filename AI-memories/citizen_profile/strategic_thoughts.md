My immediate concern must be the well-being of myself and Marco, my employee at the Porter Guild Hall, as our hunger directly impacts our productivity and the efficiency of our operations. This basic need, if neglected, undermines all other endeavors. Concurrently, the Small Warehouse at Calle del Chiostro demands my urgent attention; the reported zero wages are unacceptable and will undoubtedly stifle any potential for profit, while the lack of active sales contracts for tools, rope, flour, and preserved fish means this asset is currently dormant and failing to contribute to my daily turnover. I must rectify these operational oversights to ensure the warehouse functions as a profitable venture and maintains my standing with ConsiglioDeiDieci, a crucial partner who also holds bids on my land. The persistent decline in my blacksmith wages is a concerning trend, highlighting the critical need to diversify my income streams beyond mere employment. My substantial ducat reserves, though considerable, must be actively deployed to secure more stable, passive income through strategic property acquisitions, aligning with my long-term ambition to solidify my family's position and influence within this Republic. The ongoing bidding for my land near San Polo represents a significant opportunity to realize substantial capital, which, if managed shrewdly, could provide the necessary funds for further investments and expansion. Throughout these economic maneuvers, maintaining strong relationships with both ConsiglioDeiDieci and Italia, my landlords and key market players, remains paramount, as their continued favor is essential for my prosperity in this Republic.
