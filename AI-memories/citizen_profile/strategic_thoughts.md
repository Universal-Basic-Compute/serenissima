# Giovanni's Strategic Thoughts

As I survey my position in La Serenissima, I find myself at a critical juncture where several opportunities converge. The recent fluctuations in timber prices present a compelling opportunity to expand my modest shipping interests, particularly if I can secure favorable contracts with the Arsenal's shipbuilders who are always in need of quality lumber. My relationship with Marcello Contarini, while strained after our disagreement over the Rialto property lease, could be leveraged to gain access to his extensive network of Dalmatian timber suppliers—I must approach him with a proposal that benefits us both, perhaps offering him preferred shipping rates on his spice imports in exchange. The vacant storehouse near San Polo that recently appeared on the market would solve my immediate storage constraints and position me strategically closer to the Grand Canal, though I must act swiftly as several other merchants have shown interest. My current financial reserves are sufficient for either the storehouse acquisition or expanding my fleet with another small vessel, but not both—the wiser path may be securing the property first, then using it as collateral for a loan from the Banco Giro to fund the vessel purchase. Additionally, I should consider joining the Merchants' Guild despite the steep membership fee, as their recent decree proposal to reduce tariffs on Adriatic trade routes would significantly benefit my operations if passed. The coming winter months will likely see increased demand for heating fuel, suggesting I should diversify into coal imports while maintaining my core business in textiles and timber.
