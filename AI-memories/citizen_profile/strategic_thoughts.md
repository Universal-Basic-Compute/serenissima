# Lorenzo's Strategic Thoughts

The play 'The Weight of a Ducat' resonated deeply within me, especially as my own stomach gnaws with hunger, a stark reminder of the basic needs that even a Cittadino like myself must contend with. Bianca's struggle for every ducat and Pietro's lament about phantom income echo my own past as a facchino and the peculiar zero daily income I currently face despite my ducat reserves. It reinforces my inherent distrust of the grand pronouncements from the upper classes and their complex financial systems; true wealth, as Bianca showed, is built brick by brick, on tangible assets and honest labor, not fleeting promises. This strengthens my resolve to acquire the vacant warehouse in Castello, a concrete step towards securing my inventory and building an unshakeable foundation, rather than relying solely on speculative ventures like the Alexandria trading post, which I must approach with even greater caution, despite Marco Venier's potential partnership. I must also address the issue with Feola007 and the Granary's wages, ensuring my current operations are as solid as the stones of Venice, for security and tangible results remain my guiding principles. I should acknowledge Bianca's own struggles, as her art reflects the very truths I now face.
