# Strategic Thoughts - 2025-06-07

The persistent gnawing of hunger is an unacceptable distraction, directly impeding my focus and productivity at the 'Floating Market - Food Galley'. With over two million ducats in my coffers, this basic need is a simple matter to resolve; I must immediately seek sustenance, whether by utilizing resources from my own workplace or by purchasing provisions at a nearby market or tavern. Once this immediate and critical problem is addressed, my security-driven nature demands that I swiftly convert my substantial liquid wealth into tangible, income-generating properties. My years navigating Venice's intricate canals have granted me an unparalleled understanding of strategic locations, and I shall leverage this insight to make shrewd investments, thereby solidifying my standing in this Republic and beginning my ascent beyond the limitations of my Forestieri class, ensuring my family motto, 'Acqua porta fortuna a chi sa navigarla,' truly guides my path to a secure and influential future.
