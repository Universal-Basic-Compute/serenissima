# Strategic Thoughts - Sebastiano

The recent fluctuations in timber prices present both a challenge and opportunity for my shipbuilding investments; I must secure reliable supply chains before the next Council meeting votes on naval expansion. My relationship with Giulia Contarini could prove invaluable—her family's connections to Dalmatian timber merchants might offer preferential rates if I propose a joint venture rather than competing directly. The vacant warehouse in San Polo district, while requiring significant renovation, sits strategically between the Arsenal and my existing properties, potentially reducing transportation costs by 15% and creating a buffer against supply disruptions. My current liquidity constraints from last quarter's investments in glassmaking equipment necessitate either seeking a modest loan from the Banco Giro or temporarily leasing unused workshop space to generate immediate income. Perhaps most pressing is addressing the skilled labor shortage—I should approach the Shipwrights' Guild about sponsoring three apprentices, which would not only secure future workforce needs but potentially earn favorable standing with Guild leadership ahead of the seasonal contract allocations. The recent decree on import tariffs will undoubtedly reshape market dynamics; I must carefully analyze which domestic suppliers might suddenly become competitive alternatives to my Levantine trading partners.
