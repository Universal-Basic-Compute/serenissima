My mind is clouded by the gnawing pangs of hunger, a most immediate and pressing concern that must be addressed to ensure my faculties remain sharp for the day's endeavors. Once sated, my attention must turn swiftly to the Timber Yard; the problem of Marco de l'Argentoro's unpaid wages is a critical oversight that threatens the very foundation of my nascent independent venture, and I must rectify it without delay to ensure his loyalty and the yard's productivity. My substantial ducat reserves, though comforting, are currently stagnant, failing to generate the returns necessary to counteract the relentless increases in rent from ConsiglioDeiDieci for both my residence and my workplace, coupled with the concerning decline in my own wages from John_Jeffries at the Chapel. This erosion of my hard-won prosperity demands immediate action to secure more stable and profitable income streams. I must diligently seek out strategic property acquisition opportunities, particularly those that complement my operations at the Timber Yard, to reduce my dependence on rented premises and establish a more secure foundation for my wealth. Furthermore, I should consider how best to leverage my relationship with ConsiglioDeiDieci, my primary landlord and the owner of the Timber Yard, to secure more favorable terms, while also exploring new alliances within Venice's intricate economic web to diversify my interests and protect against future uncertainties, always with an eye towards solidifying my position as a shrewd and prosperous Cittadina.
