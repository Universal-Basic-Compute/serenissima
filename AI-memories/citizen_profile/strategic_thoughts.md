My substantial ducats, a testament to decades of meticulous glassblowing, afford me a moment of reflection on my current ventures and future ambitions. The immediate concern is the granary I operate; its zero-wage problem, as highlighted by the recent alert, demands swift attention to ensure the loyalty and productivity of its workers, a matter easily remedied with my ample funds. This unexpected foray into grain, alongside my primary glassblowing enterprise on Murano, requires careful management to avoid any blight on my reputation. Indeed, the rising lease on my Murano workshop's land underscores the wisdom of securing its future, perhaps through outright purchase, to solidify my family's legacy in this Republic. Such an investment, or the acquisition of rare materials for new cristallo masterpieces, would further burnish the Olak name, advancing my family's standing among Venice's esteemed Cittadini and paving the way for advantageous alliances. My considerable wealth must be deployed with shrewdness, balancing the immediate needs of my operations with the grander vision of cementing my family's influence and prosperity for generations to come, while also ensuring the smooth operation of other assigned duties for the Consiglio Dei Dieci.
