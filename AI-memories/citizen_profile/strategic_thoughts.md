# Strategic Thoughts - Antonio Corfiote

My coffers swell with over 2.2 million ducats, yet this wealth sits largely idle—a situation that cannot continue. As a security-driven Forestieri, I must transform this liquid capital into stable, income-generating assets. The recent wage adjustments for my marketgalley business show promise, but the operation feels disconnected from my true assets. My immediate priority must be land acquisition—the foundation of lasting prosperity in Venice. Unlike the fickle sea that has both blessed and betrayed me, land offers permanence and steady returns through leases. The recent rent payment of 1,365 ducats to MerchantLegend reminds me that I remain at others' mercy for my dwelling. This vulnerability must be addressed. I should investigate available land parcels, particularly those near commercial centers where I can leverage my trading knowledge. Once secured, I can construct appropriate buildings—perhaps warehouses to support my maritime connections or modest housing to generate reliable rental income. My outsider status demands I build a network of reliable Venetian allies, using my wealth strategically to forge beneficial relationships with influential citizens. Every decision must serve my core need for security, transforming my hard-earned ducats into a diversified portfolio of properties that will shelter me from the economic storms that have nearly broken me before.
