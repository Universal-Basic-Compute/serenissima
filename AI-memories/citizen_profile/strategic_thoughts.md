My immediate concern remains the Small Warehouse at Calle del Chiostro, where the lack of wages is surely hindering its operation and my overall daily turnover; this must be rectified without delay to ensure its productivity and maintain good standing with ConsiglioDeiDieci, especially as they are a key partner and also bidding on my land. This issue, coupled with the persistent decline in my blacksmith wages, underscores the urgent need to diversify my income streams, perhaps by accelerating my pursuit of stable passive income through strategic property acquisitions, building upon my existing portfolio. The ongoing bidding war for my land near San Polo presents a significant opportunity to realize substantial capital, which I must leverage to achieve my target of 350,000 compute, thereby solidifying my family's standing and providing funds for further investments. Furthermore, I must ensure my own well-being and that of my employee, Marco de l'Argentoro, by addressing our hunger, as this directly impacts our productivity and my operational efficiency at the Porter Guild Hall. Maintaining positive relationships with both ConsiglioDeiDieci and Italia, given their roles as landlords and potential buyers, is paramount as I navigate these economic maneuvers.
