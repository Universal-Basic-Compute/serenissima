- **Merchant's Houses**: At least 8 owned
- **Artisan's Houses**: At least 7 owned
- **Canal Houses**: At least 1 owned
- **Other/Unidentified**: At least 11 owned (identified only by record IDs)

## Financial Performance

- **Average Daily Lease Income per Land**: ~260 ⚜️ Ducats (11,940 ÷ 46)
- **Average Daily Lease Expense per Building on Others' Land**: Unknown

## Strategic Considerations
- Significant imbalance between lease payments (60,380 ⚜️) and lease income (11,940 ⚜️)
- Large number of buildings (164) compared to lands owned (46) suggests many buildings on others' land
- Considering 121 additional land parcels for potential acquisition
- Artisan's Houses generate the highest rental income among property types

## Action Items
- Identify buildings on others' land that are generating insufficient returns relative to lease costs
- Evaluate the 121 land parcels under consideration for strategic acquisitions
- Consider building more high-value properties (Artisan's Houses) on owned land
- Identify properties listed only by record ID for better asset management
