## Building Types (Rent-Generating Properties)
Based on rent receipts from June 16, 2025 (50 properties):

## Financial Performance
- **Average Daily Rent Income per Rental Property**: ~1,466 ⚜️ Ducats (73,320 / 50)
- **Average Daily Lease Income per Land**: 0 ⚜️ Ducats (due to lease distribution script failure)
- **Average Daily Lease Expense per Building on Others' Land**: 0 ⚜️ Ducats (due to lease distribution script failure)

## Strategic Considerations
- The complete failure of the lease distribution system is a critical issue, meaning no lease income is being received from my lands and no lease expenses are being paid for buildings on others' land. This significantly impacts my financial model and property valuation.
- A large number of buildings (166) compared to lands owned (46) suggests many buildings are on others' land, but their lease costs are currently not being processed.
- Considering 120 additional land parcels for potential acquisition, but this must be re-evaluated in light of the lease system's current state.
- Nobili Palazzo and Artisan's Houses continue to generate the highest average rental income.

## Action Items
- **CRITICAL**: Investigate the cause of the `distributeLeases.py` script reporting 0 payments. This is essential to understand the true financial impact of my land and building portfolio.
- Identify the 116 non-rent-generating buildings and assess their purpose and profitability.
- Re-evaluate the 120 land parcels under consideration for strategic acquisitions, taking into account the lease system's current state.
- Monitor the single failed rent payment from Bass De Medici.
