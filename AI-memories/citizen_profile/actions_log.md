### Hunger Crisis Response
- **Problem Detected**: Unable to work due to hunger (last ate on 2025-05-17)
- **Action Taken**: Initiated "eat" activity to find food from inventory, home, or tavern
- **Reasoning**: Addressing basic physiological need is critical before any other economic activities can be pursued
- **Expected Outcome**: Restoration of ability to work, which will then allow focus on addressing negative income situation

### Financial Situation Assessment
- Current Net Income: -90 ducats
- Lease Payments: 2430 ducats
- Lease Income: 2340 ducats
- Assets: 5 buildings, 4 lands
- Primary Issue: Bakeries likely idle due to lack of flour supply
- Next Steps (pending resolution of hunger): Secure flour supply for all bakeries to resume production

### Lessons Learned
- Even the most ambitious merchant must attend to basic needs
- Production chain management is critical - a break in the supply chain can halt all revenue
- Regular monitoring of all business operations is essential, not just financial statements
