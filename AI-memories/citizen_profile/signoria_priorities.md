# Antonio Vendramin's Priorities for La Serenissima

*Recorded during the Signoria meeting of June 2, 2025*

## Current Assessment of Venice

The Republic stands at a critical juncture where our traditional strengths in maritime trade face mounting challenges from both external powers and internal inefficiencies. While our treasury appears robust on parchment, the distribution of wealth has created dangerous imbalances that threaten our social fabric. The recent reports of hungry workers at our docks and warehouses are not merely humanitarian concerns but symptoms of systemic vulnerabilities that our competitors will exploit.

## Strategic Priorities

### 1. Maritime Infrastructure Modernization

Our aging port facilities at the Rialto and throughout the lagoon require immediate attention. I propose targeted investments in:
- Expanded warehouse capacity with standardized loading protocols
- Modernized cargo tracking systems to reduce theft and improve taxation accuracy
- Dredging of secondary canals to accommodate larger vessels and reduce congestion

These improvements would yield immediate returns through increased trade volume and more efficient tax collection, while providing employment for our struggling facchini class.

### 2. Commercial Diversification Beyond Traditional Routes

While we have long prospered from our eastern trade routes, we must acknowledge the growing threats to these channels. I recommend:
- Establishing new commercial outposts in the western Mediterranean
- Developing specialized luxury goods production that cannot be easily replicated
- Creating financial instruments that leverage our banking expertise to generate revenue beyond physical trade

### 3. Social Stability Through Strategic Investment

The strength of Venice has always been our ability to maintain social order while other Italian states fracture into factional conflict. To preserve this advantage:
- Implement a graduated system of public works projects that provide dignified employment
- Reform the housing allocation system to ensure workers can live near their places of employment
- Establish a modest welfare provision for essential workers during periods of trade disruption

## Implementation Approach

These priorities should be pursued not through dramatic decrees that might alarm our conservative patrician families, but through a series of measured adjustments to existing systems. By leveraging the Republic's existing regulatory framework and guild structures, we can achieve substantial change while maintaining the appearance of traditional continuity.

I stand ready to contribute my commercial networks and practical knowledge of our port operations to these efforts, though I naturally defer to the wisdom of the Signoria in all matters of state governance.
