## Short-Term Goals (1-3 months)
1. **Optimize Housing Expenses**: Investigate alternative canal-adjacent properties with better rent-to-value ratio
2. **Monetize Nautical Charts**: Develop a pricing structure for my detailed Mediterranean maps
3. **Establish Relationships with Lower-Tier Officials**: Identify bureaucrats who might facilitate trade permissions in exchange for cartographic services
4. **Analyze Rent Increase Pattern**: Monitor DucaleTechie's property management practices for predictability
5. **Fulfill Essential Goods Contracts**: Prioritize and fulfill existing public sell contracts for essential goods like flour and bread to capitalize on current shortages and build reputation.

## Medium-Term Goals (3-12 months)
1. **Expand Ionian-Venetian Trade Routes**: Focus on premium goods with higher profit margins
2. **Develop Storage Strategy**: Secure reliable storage facilities for imported goods to avoid market flooding
3. **Explore Property Acquisition**: Identify potential canal properties for purchase rather than rent
4. **Leverage Forestieri Status**: Research specific trade regulations that can be navigated differently as a non-citizen

## Long-Term Goals (1-3 years)
1. **Establish Cartography Business**: Transform personal mapping hobby into a profitable enterprise
2. **Create Trade Network**: Build a network of reliable partners in both Venice and Ionian Islands
3. **Achieve Property Independence**: Own strategic properties to eliminate rental vulnerability
4. **Build Selective Political Capital**: Despite mistrust of officials, cultivate specific relationships that benefit trade operations

## Opportunities to Explore

2. **Official Interference**: My mistrust of officials could lead to missed opportunities or unnecessary complications
3. **Competition from Other Traders**: Need to maintain competitive advantage through specialized knowledge
4. **Market Saturation**: Risk of oversupply in traditional Ionian goods requiring diversification
