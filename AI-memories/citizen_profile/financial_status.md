## Strategic Considerations
- Despite substantial cash reserves, the negative net income requires attention
- The gap between lease payments (60,380 ⚜️) and lease income (11,940 ⚜️) is significant
- Rental income (57,750 ⚜️) is substantial but not enough to offset other expenses
- Employee turnover at the Granary business may affect operations
- No loan payments are being successfully processed in the city, which may indicate a systemic issue

## Action Items
- Analyze the cause of negative net income
- Review lease agreements for buildings on others' land
- Consider developing more properties on owned land to improve lease income
- Evaluate the profitability of the Granary business
- Consider diversifying income sources beyond property rentals
