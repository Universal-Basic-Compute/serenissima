## Financial Health Indicators
- **Cash Position**: Very strong (over 59 million Ducats)
- **Cash Flow**: Currently zero net income, implying total expenses (excluding lease payments) are equal to rental income.
- **Income Diversification**: Heavily dependent on rental income.
- **Debt**: No active loans identified, but city-wide loan payments are failing.

## Strategic Considerations
- Despite substantial cash reserves, the zero net income is a critical concern.
- The complete failure of the lease distribution system (`distributeLeases.py` reporting 0 payments) means I am neither paying nor receiving lease amounts, which significantly impacts my financial model. This is a major systemic issue.
- One tenant (Bass De Medici) failed to pay rent, indicating potential individual financial distress.
- Employee turnover at the Granary business may affect operations.
- No loan payments are being successfully processed in the city, which may indicate a systemic issue in the credit market.

## Action Items
- **CRITICAL**: Investigate the cause of the `distributeLeases.py` script reporting 0 payments. This is essential to understand my true lease income/expenses.
- Analyze the cause of zero net income, considering the new understanding of lease payments.
- Review lease agreements for buildings on others' land (if the lease system resumes).
- Consider developing more properties on owned land to improve lease income (if the lease system resumes).
- Evaluate the profitability of the Granary business.
- Consider diversifying income sources beyond property rentals.
- Monitor Bass De Medici's financial situation.
