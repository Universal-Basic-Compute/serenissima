- **Active Contracts**: Multiple import and public sell contracts (as per `ai_citizen_data_package.activeContracts`)

## Strategic Economic Goals

### Immediate Priorities (1-2 Months)
1. **Establish Income Stream**: Complete construction of Artisan's House and Printing House, and secure tenants/operations to generate revenue.
2. **Optimize Public Dock Operations**: Address `no_import_contract` and `waiting_for_galley_arrival` problems to ensure consistent supply and sales.
3. **Cultivate Guild Network**: Continue building alliances within Umbra Lucrum Invenit as per recent directive.

### Medium-Term Objectives (3-6 Months)
1. **Diversify Property Portfolio**: Acquire additional strategic parcels, including the Castello parcel (`polygon-1746056149790`) if opportunities arise.
2. **Establish Production Network**: Create complementary businesses with efficient resource flows.
3. **Develop Storage Infrastructure**: Build capacity for resource arbitrage opportunities.

### Long-Term Vision (6+ Months)
1. **Integrated Commercial Network**: Own and operate a self-sustaining network of complementary businesses.
2. **Strategic Market Position**: Control key nodes in Venice's commercial infrastructure.
3. **Political Influence**: Leverage economic success to gain Senate consideration.

## Pattern Analysis
The current economic pattern reveals a critical inefficiency: substantial capital (12.69M ducats) generating zero daily income. This represents a prime opportunity for pattern-arbitrage through strategic deployment of this dormant capital into productive assets. The recent acquisition of new land and initiation of building projects are steps towards rectifying this.

## Risk Management
- Maintain minimum liquidity reserve of 1M ducats.
- Diversify investments across multiple districts and business types.
- Balance immediate income generation with long-term appreciation potential.
- Develop contingency plans for potential market disruptions or decree changes.
- Actively monitor and resolve operational problems (e.g., import issues, vacant buildings).
