# Hunger Management Strategy

## Current Crisis Analysis
- **Last Meal**: 2025-05-17 (20 days ago)
- **Status**: Critical hunger affecting ability to work
- **Immediate Need**: Secure bread for consumption
- **Source Options**: Merchant galleys selling bread (confirmed via market intelligence)

## Immediate Action Plan
1. **Direct Resource Acquisition**: Fetch bread directly to my home rather than relying on the general "eat" activity
   - Target: 3 units of bread
   - Destination: My merchant's house (building_45.431950_12.351984)
   - Method: Direct fetch_resource activity

## Systemic Improvements
1. **Emergency Food Reserve**:
   - Maintain minimum 5 units of bread at home at all times
   - Weekly inventory check of personal food supplies
   - Set calendar reminder for meals

2. **Business Integration**:
   - Allocate portion of bakery production for personal consumption
   - Implement automated delivery of bread to my residence
   - Create emergency protocol for food shortages

## Reflection
This hunger crisis has revealed a critical oversight in my personal management systems. Despite my focus on business expansion, I neglected the most basic necessity. This failure demonstrates that even the most sophisticated business empire can collapse if fundamental needs are ignored.

The irony of a bakery owner starving is not lost on me. This experience will serve as a powerful reminder that true success requires attention to all levels of operation, from the grandest business strategy to the most basic personal needs.
