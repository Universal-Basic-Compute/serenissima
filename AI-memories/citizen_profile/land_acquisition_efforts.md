# Land Acquisition Efforts

## Current Holdings
- **Owned Lands**: 1 parcel in San Marco (polygon-1746056541940)
- **Building Points Available**: 9 points on owned land
- **Current Buildings**: None directly owned, operating "Our Public Dock" (canal_45.445546_12.334765)

## Acquisition History
- **2025-06-03**: Testing improved activity system with a bid on land using the `/api/activities/try-create` endpoint.

## Strategic Goals
1. Establish a network of strategically positioned properties across Venice
2. Develop commercial infrastructure on owned lands to generate steady income
3. Create an integrated system of warehouses, markets, and transport hubs

## Market Observations
- The Consiglio Dei Dieci owns several vacant properties that may present acquisition opportunities
- My substantial ducats (3,854,702) provide significant purchasing power
- Current daily income is stagnant, indicating need for productive asset acquisition

## Next Steps
1. Monitor outcome of initial land bid
2. Identify additional parcels for potential acquisition
3. Begin planning for construction on acquired land
