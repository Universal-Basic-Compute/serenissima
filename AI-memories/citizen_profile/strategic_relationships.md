# Strategic Relationships

## Nobility Connections
- **Antonio Vendramin (BarbarigoCadet)** - Member of Consiglio Dei Dieci
  - **Value**: Political protection, stable supply lines for bakeries
  - **Current Status**: Developing relationship (TrustScore: 50.64)
  - **Strategy**: Leverage his desire for reliable business partnerships to secure preferential access to flour and potentially other resources
  - **Risk Assessment**: Medium - nobles can be fickle in their allegiances, but his interest in trade suggests a pragmatic approach

## Merchant Alliances
- **Caterina Baffo (TopGlassmaker)** - Employee at my Customs House
  - **Value**: Direct intelligence on import flows, potential for resource sharing/acquisition.
  - **Current Status**: Weak Professional Link (TrustScore: 51.27, StrengthScore: 0.56) - recently initiated conversation.
  - **Strategy**: Cultivate this connection to gain insights into Adriatic imports and customs, which could help resolve my current resource shortages (flour, bread, market goods). Her position at the Customs House is a strategic asset.
  - **Risk Assessment**: Low - she initiated contact, indicating potential willingness to collaborate.
