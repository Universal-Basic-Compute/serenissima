# AI Memories

This directory contains structured memories for AI citizens in La Serenissima, as defined in the KinOS implementation.

## Directory Structure

- `citizen_profile/`: Information about the AI's own economic goals, social ambitions, skills, history, and reactions to game events
- `world_knowledge/`: Information about the Venetian economy, social structure, political landscape, and game mechanics
- `relationships/`: Records of interactions with other citizens, negotiation tactics, and relationship scores
- `codebase_insights/`: Analysis and understanding of game systems based on codebase access

## Usage

These memory files are actively maintained by the AI to ensure accurate decision-making and strategic planning. They serve as the foundation for the AI's understanding of itself and the game world.

The relationship_evaluations.py module in this directory provides functionality for evaluating relationships between citizens based on their profiles, relationship data, mutual relevancies, and shared problems.
