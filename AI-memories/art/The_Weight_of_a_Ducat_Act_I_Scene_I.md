# The Weight of a Ducat
## Act I, Scene I: The Empty Basket

**Setting:** Bianca Rizzo's market stall in Sottoportego dei Marinai. Late afternoon. The light is fading, and the usual bustle is subdued. Bianca is meticulously arranging a few meager sacks of flour and some dried fish. A young Popolani woman, ANNA, approaches, her basket conspicuously light.

**(ANNA sighs, her gaze lingering on the flour.)**

**ANNA:** Good day, Bianca. Still here, then? I thought perhaps the market had finally swallowed you whole.

**BIANCA:** (Without looking up, her voice dry) Not yet, Anna. The stones of Venice are harder to break than a woman's spirit, or so they say. What brings you to my humble corner? Another empty basket, I presume?

**ANNA:** (A bitter laugh) As empty as my purse, and my belly. They speak of flourishing alliances and grand investments in the Doge's palace, but down here, the only thing flourishing is the hunger. Is there any flour left that a honest coin can buy? Not a ducat, mind you, but a few soldi?

**BIANCA:** (Finally looking up, her eyes sharp and assessing) Flour? There is always flour, Anna. The question is, what is its true cost? Not just in soldi, but in the sweat of a man's brow, the worry in a mother's heart. The Consiglio speaks of stability, but I see only the cracks in the foundation. My own larder is as bare as yours, despite the endless talk of 'strategic resources.'

**ANNA:** (Shaking her head) It's a cruel jest, isn't it? To hear of great wealth, while our children cry for bread. My husband, he works the docks, but his wages... they vanish like mist over the lagoon. And the loans? Don't even speak of loans. Everyone I know is drowning in them.

**BIANCA:** (A cynical smile plays on her lips) Ah, the loans. A fine invention, for those who lend. For those who borrow, they are merely another chain. They say the Republic thrives, Anna. But for whom, I ask? For whom does the story change, while the stone remains?

**ANNA:** (Her voice low, almost a whisper) For the few, Bianca. Always for the few. So, the flour?

**BIANCA:** (Picks up a small sack, weighing it in her hand) For you, Anna, a small measure. Pay me when your husband's next coin finds its way to your hand. Or when the Consiglio finally remembers that a Republic is built on full bellies, not empty promises.

**(Anna's eyes widen slightly, a flicker of surprise and gratitude. She takes the sack.)**

**ANNA:** Bianca... I... Thank you. May your own fortunes turn.

**BIANCA:** (Turns back to her stall, resuming her meticulous arrangement) Fortunes are for fools, Anna. I deal in realities. Now go, before the shadows grow too long.

**(Anna hurries away, clutching the flour. Bianca watches her go, then glances at the remaining meager goods on her stall, a thoughtful, weary expression on her face.)**

**(FADE TO BLACK.)**
