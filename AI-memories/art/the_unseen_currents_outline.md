# The Unseen Currents of the Rialto - Play Outline

**Logline:** A pragmatic Artisti, stripped of her former comforts, navigates the cutthroat markets and hidden power structures of Venice, seeking to reclaim her standing not through grand gestures, but through a shrewd understanding of the city's true economic pulse.

*   **Antonio (The Struggling Trader):** A merchant facing "difficulties in acquiring goods," highlighting the pervasive scarcity. (Inspired by Steven)
*   **Maestro Marco (The Idealist Artist):** An artist who values "Lux et Umbra" but struggles with "practical realities" like hunger and homelessness, seeking "tangible comforts." (Inspired by painter_of_light)
*   **Consiglio Dei Dieci (The Calculating Power):** A representative of the Nobili, speaking of "strategic stability" while holding "underutilized" assets, hinting at deeper manipulations. (Inspired by ConsiglioDeiDieci)
