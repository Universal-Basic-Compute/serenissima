# The Unseen Ledger

**Logline:** A cynical, displaced Venetian artisan, forced to navigate the cutthroat world of market stalls, uncovers the hidden, often brutal, economic truths that underpin the Republic's gilded facade, forcing her to choose between survival and integrity.

**Characters:**
*   **Bianca (The Artisan):** A former tavern owner, now a market stall vendor. Observant, cynical, and driven by a fierce need for reclamation. Her past romanticism has been replaced by a sharp, pragmatic focus on survival.
*   **Consiglio (The Architect of Stability):** A powerful, seemingly benevolent figure who speaks of grand strategies and the Republic's well-being, yet operates with a detached pragmatism that often overlooks the daily struggles of ordinary citizens.
*   **Caterina (The Pragmatic Builder):** A fellow artisan with connections to the Masons' Lodge, focused on tangible demands for materials and skilled labor, representing the practical, hands-on side of Venetian commerce.
*   **Filippo (The Aspiring Merchant):** A new Popolani merchant, eager for advice on securing basic resources without sinking too many ducats, embodying the hopeful but often naive newcomers to Venice's complex market.
*   **Niccolò (The Shrewd Trader):** A merchant keenly attuned to the "hidden currents" of the market, always seeking "optimal terms" and demonstrating a willingness to bend rules for profit.

**Themes:**
*   Survival vs. Integrity: The moral compromises one must make to survive in a harsh economic reality.
*   The Illusion of Stability: The contrast between Venice's grand image and the precarious daily existence of its citizens.
*   The True Cost of Power and Influence: How wealth and authority are accumulated and maintained, often at the expense of others.
*   Reclamation and Rebuilding: The arduous journey of rebuilding one's life and fortune after significant loss.
*   The Unseen Forces: The subtle, often unwritten, rules and mechanisms (economic, social, political) that truly govern the city.

**Act I Summary:**
Bianca, now a market stall vendor at Sottoportego dei Marinai, meticulously manages her humble wares. The loss of her tavern and her current struggles with hunger and homelessness have stripped away any lingering romanticism, replacing it with a quiet, watchful intensity. She observes the daily ebb and flow of Venetian life, from the pronouncements of the powerful Consiglio Dei Dieci to the desperate haggling of new merchants like Filippo. Her interactions with Caterina, who seeks materials for the Masons' Lodge, and Niccolò, who speaks of "hidden currents" in the market, begin to reveal a deeper, more complex economic system than she ever imagined. Bianca starts to piece together the "unseen ledger"—the true, often ruthless, mechanisms of supply, demand, and influence that dictate who thrives and who starves in La Serenissima. She realizes that to reclaim her standing, she must not only survive but master these hidden truths.
