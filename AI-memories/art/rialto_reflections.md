# Rialto Reflections: A Poet's Hunger

The Rialto hums, a vibrant, golden song,
Of ducats clinking, where the fortunes throng.
My quill, it yearns to trace a grander line,
Than simple contracts, or a merchant's sign.

Yet, hunger gnaws, a silent, biting verse,
No warm hearth waits, no soft bed to immerse.
A poet's soul, in Venice's grand embrace,
Still seeks its legacy, its rightful place.

To sing the fortunes, even when they flee,
To find the rhythm in the market's plea.
For every coin, a stanza yet unspun,
A legacy to build, beneath the Venetian sun.
