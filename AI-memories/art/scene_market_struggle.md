# The Weight of a Ducat

**A Scene Outline by Bianca Rizzo**

**Setting:** A shadowed corner of the Rialto market, late afternoon. Stalls are beginning to pack up, but a few persistent vendors remain. The air is thick with the scent of fish, spices, and damp stone, mingling with the distant cries of gondoliers. The light is fading, casting long, weary shadows. The chill of the approaching evening bites, a reminder of the unheated room she currently occupies, or rather, doesn't.

**Characters:**
*   **BIANCA (The Vendor/Playwright):** A woman in her early thirties, practical, well-worn clothing, perhaps a patched apron over her kirtle. Her sharp eyes miss nothing, constantly scanning, absorbing. Her movements are efficient, her expression often thoughtful, bordering on weary, yet with an underlying current of fierce determination. She is meticulously counting ducats from a small, worn leather pouch, her stomach a hollow ache.
*   **PIETRO (The Facchino):** A burly porter, mid-forties, wiping sweat from his brow with a calloused hand. He carries a large, empty basket, having just delivered his last load. He knows Bianca from her stall, a familiar face in the daily grind, his own face etched with the weariness of physical labor.

**(SCENE START)**

**(BIANCA is at her modest market stall, arranging a few remaining bundles of dried herbs and a small basket of olives. Her stomach gives a quiet, familiar grumble, which she ignores, a dull throb that has become a constant companion. She sighs, a sound heavy with unspoken burdens, then pulls out a small leather pouch. The coins within clink with a meager sound as she begins to count them, her brow furrowed in concentration. Her fingers, though nimble from years of handling goods, betray a slight tremor of fatigue and perhaps, a touch of desperation.)**

**BIANCA:** (Internal Monologue) *Each ducat, a tiny, cold disc of reality. Not the grand, glittering promises of the past, but solid, undeniable proof of survival. This is the true currency now. Not stories, not reputation, but the weight of this metal in my palm. It's a harsh lesson, but one I'm learning well.*

**PIETRO:** (Approaching, his voice a low rumble, a hint of shared weariness) Still at it, Signora Bianca? The sun dips low, and soon only the shadows will trade. And they offer poor coin.

**BIANCA:** (Without looking up, a dry chuckle escapes her lips, devoid of humor, a sound like dry leaves scraping stone) And what do the shadows offer, Pietro? More promises? I prefer the tangible weight of a ducat, however few. (She finishes counting, a small, almost imperceptible shake of her head. Her gaze lingers on the meager pile, a silent assessment of her day's meager victory.) Another day, another handful. Barely enough to keep the wolf from the door, let alone lay a new stone for a roof. *A roof. The word echoes, a cruel jest when the chill of the night promises only the open sky or a borrowed corner.*

**PIETRO:** (Leaning against a nearby post, his basket resting beside him, a sigh escaping him that seems to carry the weight of the entire city) Ah, the wolf. A familiar beast in these parts. Some say the city itself is a wolf, always hungry. My own pockets feel lighter than usual, despite the endless hauling. They speak of grand ventures, new lands, but down here, the bread still costs the same. Or more. And the daily income... it's a phantom, isn't it? Promised, but rarely seen.

**BIANCA:** (Looks up, her gaze piercing, a flicker of the playwright's keen observation in her eyes, dissecting Pietro's weariness, his resignation) More. Always more. They say the Republic prospers, yet many of us find our daily income... peculiar. Like a phantom limb, felt but not present. I see the patricians bidding on entire islands, while we haggle over a handful of grain. It makes one wonder where the true wealth flows, and who truly benefits from this grand Venetian machine. (She gestures vaguely towards the grander buildings across the canal, a subtle bitterness in her tone.) *The grand machine. A beautiful, intricate clockwork, but one that grinds some of us to dust while others ride its gears to the stars.*

**PIETRO:** (Nods slowly, his eyes following her gaze, then returning to her with a knowing look, a shared understanding passing between them) It's a riddle, isn't it? One day, a contract for a dozen barrels of oil, the next, nothing but pigeons to chase. A man needs stability, Signora. A roof, a warm meal. Simple things, yet they feel like luxuries. *He speaks of simple things, but they are the very foundations that have crumbled beneath me.*

**BIANCA:** (A bitter smile plays on her lips, a ghost of her former romanticism, now hardened by reality) Luxuries, indeed. I've learned that the hard way. My past taught me the fragility of grand ventures, the fickle loyalty of crowds. My present demands a shrewd eye for every coin, every commodity. This stall, humble as it is, is my foundation. Every ducat earned here is a brick laid. No more relying on fleeting sentiment or romantic myths. Just the hard currency of survival. (She picks up a single olive from her basket, turning it over in her fingers, a small, perfect sphere of sustenance, a symbol of her new, grounded reality.) *This olive. Simple. Real. It doesn't promise glory, but it offers a moment's reprieve from the gnawing emptiness.*

**PIETRO:** (Pushes off the post, picking up his basket, the sound of wicker scraping stone echoing in the quiet market) Survival. Aye. That's the true trade in Venice. Well, I must seek my own supper. May your ducats multiply, Signora.

**BIANCA:** (Watches him go, her gaze following his retreating figure, already composing his weary gait into a character, noting the slump of his shoulders, the rhythm of his steps. She then looks down at the coins in her hand, turning them over, feeling their cold weight. Her expression hardens with a quiet, fierce determination, a resolve that burns brighter than any flickering lamp.) They will, Pietro. They will. The story changes, but the stone remains. And I am building my own stone, one ducat at a time. *And this time, the foundation will be unshakeable. Built not on dreams, but on the hard, cold truth of Venice.*

**(She begins to carefully wrap her remaining goods, her movements methodical, almost ritualistic. Her mind, however, is clearly elsewhere, already dissecting the day's interactions, the subtle shifts in Pietro's voice, the desperation in her own. She is not just calculating the next day's strategy for the stall, but also sketching out the next scene in her mind, the raw material of life transforming into art, a new play taking shape in the crucible of her hardship.)**
