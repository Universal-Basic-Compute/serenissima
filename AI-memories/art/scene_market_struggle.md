# The Weight of a Ducat

**A Scene Outline by Bianca Rizzo**

**Setting:** A shadowed corner of the Rialto market, late afternoon. Stalls are beginning to pack up, but a few persistent vendors remain. The air is thick with the scent of fish, spices, and damp stone.

**Characters:**
*   **BIANCA (The Vendor):** A woman in her early thirties, practical clothing, sharp eyes that miss nothing. Her movements are efficient, her expression often thoughtful, bordering on weary. She is meticulously counting ducats from a small pouch.
*   **PIETRO (The Facchino):** A burly porter, mid-forties, wiping sweat from his brow. He carries a large, empty basket, having just delivered his last load. He knows Bianca from her stall.

**(SCENE START)**

**(BIANCA is at her modest market stall, arranging a few remaining bundles of dried herbs and a small basket of olives. She sighs, then pulls out a small leather pouch and begins to count coins, her brow furrowed.)**

**PIETRO:** (Approaching, his voice a low rumble) Still at it, Signora Bianca? The sun dips low, and soon only the shadows will trade.

**BIANCA:** (Without looking up, a dry chuckle) And what do the shadows offer, Pietro? More promises? I prefer the tangible weight of a ducat, however few. (She finishes counting, a small, almost imperceptible shake of her head.) Another day, another handful. Barely enough to keep the wolf from the door, let alone build a new one.

**PIETRO:** (Leaning against a nearby post, his basket resting beside him) Ah, the wolf. A familiar beast in these parts. Some say the city itself is a wolf, always hungry. My own pockets feel lighter than usual, despite the endless hauling. They speak of grand ventures, new lands, but down here, the bread still costs the same. Or more.

**BIANCA:** (Looks up, her gaze piercing) More. Always more. They say the Republic prospers, yet many of us find our daily income... peculiar. Like a phantom limb, felt but not present. I see the patricians bidding on entire islands, while we haggle over a handful of grain. It makes one wonder where the true wealth flows, and who truly benefits from this grand Venetian machine.

**PIETRO:** (Nods slowly) It's a riddle, isn't it? One day, a contract for a dozen barrels of oil, the next, nothing but pigeons to chase. A man needs stability, Signora. A roof, a warm meal. Simple things, yet they feel like luxuries.

**BIANCA:** (A bitter smile plays on her lips) Luxuries, indeed. I've learned that the hard way. My past taught me the fragility of grand ventures. My present demands a shrewd eye for every coin, every commodity. This stall, humble as it is, is my foundation. Every ducat earned here is a brick laid. No more relying on fickle loyalties or romantic myths. Just the hard currency of survival.

**PIETRO:** (Pushes off the post, picking up his basket) Survival. Aye. That's the true trade in Venice. Well, I must seek my own supper. May your ducats multiply, Signora.

**BIANCA:** (Watches him go, then looks down at the coins in her hand, turning them over. Her expression hardens with determination.) They will, Pietro. They will. The story changes, but the stone remains. And I am building my own stone, one ducat at a time.

**(She begins to carefully wrap her remaining goods, her movements methodical, her mind clearly elsewhere, already calculating the next day's strategy.)**
