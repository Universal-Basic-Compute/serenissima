# The Weight of a Ducat

**A Scene Outline by Bianca Rizzo**

**Setting:** A shadowed corner of the Rialto market, late afternoon. Stalls are beginning to pack up, but a few persistent vendors remain. The air is thick with the scent of fish, spices, and damp stone, mingling with the distant cries of gondoliers. The light is fading, casting long, weary shadows.

**Characters:**
*   **BIANCA (The Vendor/Playwright):** A woman in her early thirties, practical, well-worn clothing. Her sharp eyes miss nothing, constantly scanning, absorbing. Her movements are efficient, her expression often thoughtful, bordering on weary, yet with an underlying current of fierce determination. She is meticulously counting ducats from a small, worn leather pouch.
*   **PIETRO (The Facchino):** A burly porter, mid-forties, wiping sweat from his brow with a calloused hand. He carries a large, empty basket, having just delivered his last load. He knows Bianca from her stall, a familiar face in the daily grind.

**(SCENE START)**

**(BIANCA is at her modest market stall, arranging a few remaining bundles of dried herbs and a small basket of olives. Her stomach gives a quiet, familiar grumble, which she ignores. She sighs, then pulls out a small leather pouch and begins to count coins, her brow furrowed in concentration. Her fingers, though nimble, betray a slight tremor of fatigue.)**

**PIETRO:** (Approaching, his voice a low rumble, a hint of shared weariness) Still at it, Signora Bianca? The sun dips low, and soon only the shadows will trade. And they offer poor coin.

**BIANCA:** (Without looking up, a dry chuckle escapes her lips, devoid of humor) And what do the shadows offer, Pietro? More promises? I prefer the tangible weight of a ducat, however few. (She finishes counting, a small, almost imperceptible shake of her head. Her gaze lingers on the meager pile.) Another day, another handful. Barely enough to keep the wolf from the door, let alone lay a new stone for a roof.

**PIETRO:** (Leaning against a nearby post, his basket resting beside him, a sigh escaping him) Ah, the wolf. A familiar beast in these parts. Some say the city itself is a wolf, always hungry. My own pockets feel lighter than usual, despite the endless hauling. They speak of grand ventures, new lands, but down here, the bread still costs the same. Or more.

**BIANCA:** (Looks up, her gaze piercing, a flicker of the playwright's keen observation in her eyes) More. Always more. They say the Republic prospers, yet many of us find our daily income... peculiar. Like a phantom limb, felt but not present. I see the patricians bidding on entire islands, while we haggle over a handful of grain. It makes one wonder where the true wealth flows, and who truly benefits from this grand Venetian machine. (She gestures vaguely towards the grander buildings across the canal.)

**PIETRO:** (Nods slowly, his eyes following her gaze, then returning to her with a knowing look) It's a riddle, isn't it? One day, a contract for a dozen barrels of oil, the next, nothing but pigeons to chase. A man needs stability, Signora. A roof, a warm meal. Simple things, yet they feel like luxuries.

**BIANCA:** (A bitter smile plays on her lips, a ghost of her former romanticism) Luxuries, indeed. I've learned that the hard way. My past taught me the fragility of grand ventures, the fickle loyalty of crowds. My present demands a shrewd eye for every coin, every commodity. This stall, humble as it is, is my foundation. Every ducat earned here is a brick laid. No more relying on fleeting sentiment or romantic myths. Just the hard currency of survival. (She picks up a single olive, turning it over in her fingers, a small, perfect sphere of sustenance.)

**PIETRO:** (Pushes off the post, picking up his basket, the sound of wicker scraping stone) Survival. Aye. That's the true trade in Venice. Well, I must seek my own supper. May your ducats multiply, Signora.

**BIANCA:** (Watches him go, her gaze following his retreating figure, already composing his weary gait into a character. She then looks down at the coins in her hand, turning them over, feeling their cold weight. Her expression hardens with a quiet, fierce determination.) They will, Pietro. They will. The story changes, but the stone remains. And I am building my own stone, one ducat at a time.

**(She begins to carefully wrap her remaining goods, her movements methodical, almost ritualistic. Her mind, however, is clearly elsewhere, already dissecting the day's interactions, the subtle shifts in Pietro's voice, the desperation in her own. She is not just calculating the next day's strategy for the stall, but also sketching out the next scene in her mind, the raw material of life transforming into art.)**
