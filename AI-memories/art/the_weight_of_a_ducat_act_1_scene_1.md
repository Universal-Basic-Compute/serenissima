# The Weight of a Ducat - Act I, Scene I

**Setting:** A narrow, bustling alleyway near Bianca Rizzo's market stall in Sottoportego dei Marinai. The air is thick with the scent of salted fish and damp stone. Early morning light struggles to pierce the high walls.

**Characters:**
*   **BIANCA RIZZO:** (Artisti, Playwright) Observant, cynical, tending her humble stall.
*   **MARCO:** (Popolani, a gaunt laborer) His clothes are worn, his eyes hollow.
*   **ELARA:** (Cittadini, a small-time merchant) Her ledger is clutched tight, her brow furrowed.

**(SCENE START)**

**(MARCO shuffles past Bianca's stall, eyeing a sack of flour with desperate hunger. BIANCA watches him, her expression unreadable.)**

**ELARA:** (Approaching Bianca, sighing heavily) Another day, another ducat lost to the currents. The Consiglio speaks of "strategic alliances" and "bearing fruit," but my ledgers tell a different tale. Loans vanish like mist, and the market stalls stand half-empty.

**BIANCA:** (Without looking up from arranging some dried herbs) The Consiglio speaks of what they *wish* to see, Elara. We, down here, see what *is*. Marco, for instance. He doesn't need alliances; he needs bread.

**(MARCO coughs weakly, his stomach rumbling audibly. He glances away, embarrassed.)**

**ELARA:** (Lowering her voice) It's this "Systemic Financial Glitch," they say. A hundred percent failure rate on loans! How is a merchant to expand, to even *survive*, when the very foundation of credit crumbles? My last shipment of timber sits idle, no one can afford to build.

**BIANCA:** (A dry chuckle escapes her) Ah, the timber. And the copper oxide, no doubt. They speak of "underutilized assets." Perhaps they mean the citizens themselves, left to wither while grand plans are whispered in gilded halls. My own purse feels the weight of every ducat, or rather, the *lack* of it.

**ELARA:** (Shaking her head) And the hunger! It's everywhere. Even the Doge's cook complains of shortages. How can Venice thrive when its belly is empty?

**BIANCA:** (Meeting Elara's gaze, a glint of something sharp in her eyes) Venice thrives on stories, Elara. And the stories being written now are not of glory, but of survival. Of the true weight of a ducat, when it's the only thing between a man and the cold stone. Perhaps it's time those stories were told on a grander stage than this alley.

**(Bianca gestures vaguely towards the wider city. MARCO shuffles away, his hunger a silent, persistent echo.)**

**ELARA:** (Looks from Bianca to the retreating Marco, a flicker of understanding in her eyes) A grander stage... You speak of plays, Bianca?

**BIANCA:** (A faint, almost imperceptible smile plays on her lips) I speak of truth, Elara. And truth, like a well-crafted play, can move mountains... or at least, ducats.
