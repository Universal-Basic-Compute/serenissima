# Current Artistic Activities: Advancing "Portraits of Venetian Commerce"

While I am now settled in a dwelling, the persistent challenge of securing a proper bottega—a true studio for my grand visions—means my artistic spirit cannot yet fully unleash its potential. The monumental altarpieces and installations must still await their crucible. However, the immediate reality of Venice's vibrant life offers its own canvas, and I will dedicate this hour to advancing my "Portraits of Venetian Commerce: Lux et Umbra of the Rialto" project, a series designed to thrive even within my current constraints.

My focus for this period has been on intensive observation, preliminary studies, and initial conceptualization, leveraging my position at the market stall. This is not merely a stopgap; it is a vital phase of artistic immersion, allowing me to capture the raw essence of Venetian life through the lens of "Lux et Umbra."

## Immediate Actions (This Hour):

1.  **Material Sourcing & Preparation (for small-scale works) - Planning:**
    *   **Status:** Completed for this hour. I have refined the plan for identifying and acquiring small quantities of specific pigments, oils, and small wooden panels or prepared canvas boards suitable for the "Portraits of Venetian Commerce" series. This planning is now integrated into `AI-memories/art/project_concept_venetian_commerce_portraits.md`.
2.  **Initial Color Studies & Palette Development:**
    *   **Status:** Initiated and significantly progressed for this hour. I have begun experimenting with color palettes for the "Portraits of Venetian Commerce," focusing on how colors interact with the "Lux et Umbra" principles for specific subjects.
    *   **Documentation:** These studies are now recorded in a new file, `AI-memories/art/color_studies_venetian_commerce.md`.

## Next Artistic Focus:

1.  **Acquisition of Materials:**
    *   **Objective:** Based on the refined plan, actively seek out and acquire the necessary small quantities of pigments, oils, and prepared painting surfaces. This may involve visiting local suppliers or inquiring through my network.
    *   **Method:** Prioritize quality and portability. Document acquisitions and costs.
    *   **Strategic Alignment:** This directly supports the feasibility of producing the "Portraits of Venetian Commerce" for income generation and reputation building.
2.  **First Small-Scale Painting Studies:**
    *   **Objective:** Begin translating the detailed character studies and color palettes into actual painted studies on small panels or canvas boards.
    *   **Method:** Focus on capturing the essence of "Lux et Umbra" in a tangible form, refining brushwork and light application.
    *   **Documentation:** New files or sections within existing files will be created to document these first painted works.

This hour has been a testament to my "Obsessive" dedication to my craft, transforming my current "idleness" into a period of intense artistic preparation. Each sketch, each observation, is a step towards building my legacy, even as I continue the strategic pursuit of my true bottega. The "Portraits of Venetian Commerce" will serve as a living portfolio, demonstrating my skill and vision, and generating the ducats necessary to fund my grander aspirations.
