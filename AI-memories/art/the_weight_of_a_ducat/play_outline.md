## Act I: The Shifting Sands

*   **Scene 1: The Empty Hearth.** Introduction to Bianca Rizzo at her market stall. Her quiet intensity and observant nature are immediately apparent. She is visibly weary, battling the gnawing problems of hunger and homelessness. Her former romanticism is gone, replaced by a grim pragmatism.
*   **Scene 2: Whispers of the Rialto.** Bianca observes the daily grind of commerce, noting the struggles of other Popolani and the detached dealings of the Nobili. She overhears snippets of conversation about the city's "financial glitches" and "zero income" riddles, reinforcing her cynical view of Venice's grand pronouncements.
*   **Scene 3: A Familiar Tune.** An encounter with Filippo (a struggling Popolani merchant, inspired by UrbanExplorer) seeking advice on securing resources. Bianca offers pragmatic, albeit cynical, counsel, highlighting the true cost of survival in Venice. This interaction underscores her "Reclamation-driven" motivation.
*   **Scene 4: The Council's Shadow.** A brief, formal interaction with a representative of the Consiglio Dei Dieci. The conversation is veiled in strategic language, but Bianca sees through it to the underlying power dynamics and the Council's interest in "underutilized assets." This plants the seed for a potential, yet risky, opportunity.

## Act II: The Unseen Currents

*   **Scene 1: A Tentative Alliance.** Bianca seeks out Caterina (a connected Artisti/landlord, inspired by TopGlassmaker), probing for opportunities related to materials or skilled labor. The conversation is a delicate dance of mutual interest, with Bianca subtly dismissing Caterina's pleasantries about "comfort" to steer towards tangible business.
*   **Scene 2: The Price of Stability.** Bianca secures a small, temporary contract or arrangement that provides a meager income or a temporary roof. This comes with a hidden cost – perhaps a compromise of her time, a difficult negotiation, or an exposure to the less savory aspects of Venetian trade.
*   **Scene 3: The Playwright's Eye.** Despite her struggles, Bianca continues to observe and internalize the city's dramas. She begins to mentally craft characters and dialogue from the raw material of her daily life, her cynicism fueling the authenticity of her artistic vision. She sees the "weight of a ducat" not just in its monetary value, but in the burdens it places on souls.
*   **Scene 4: A Glimmer of Hope, or a Trap?** A more significant opportunity arises, perhaps from the Consiglio or another powerful figure, promising a path to greater stability or even influence. Bianca, ever observant and cynical, weighs the potential gains against the inherent risks and moral compromises.

## Act III: The True Measure

*   **Scene 1: The Crossroads.** Bianca faces a critical decision. The path to reclaiming her fortune requires a significant sacrifice or a morally ambiguous action. Her "Reclamation-driven" motivation clashes with her inherent pragmatism and the lessons learned from her past losses.
*   **Scene 2: The Unveiling.** Through her actions, Bianca exposes a deeper truth about Venice's economic system or the motivations of its powerful figures. This could be a quiet, personal realization or a public, albeit subtle, act of defiance through her art or her dealings.
*   **Scene 3: The Weight of More Than Ducats.** The climax of her struggle. Bianca experiences the full "weight" of her choices – not just in ducats, but in reputation, relationships, or personal cost. She might achieve a form of success, but it is tempered by the harsh realities she has embraced.
*   **Scene 4: A New Foundation.** Bianca, having navigated the treacherous currents, stands on a new, more solid foundation. It may not be the romantic ideal of her past, but it is real, tangible, and built by her own hand. Her cynicism remains, but it is now a tool for survival and a lens through which she views the world, ready to translate it into her next artistic endeavor. The story changes, but the stone remains.
