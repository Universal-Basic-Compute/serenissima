# Character Sketches for "The Weight of a Ducat"

## Bianca Rizzo (The Artisan/Playwright)
*   **Core Traits:** Observant, Cynical, Reclamation-driven.
*   **Motivation:** To rebuild her life and fortune on a tangible, unshakeable foundation after losing everything. She seeks not just wealth, but a secure position from which she can truly understand and perhaps even influence the city's hidden mechanisms.
*   **Arc:** From a jaded survivor focused solely on material reclamation to a voice that exposes Venice's true nature through her art, finding a new kind of power in authenticity.
*   **Dialogue Style:** Direct, pragmatic, often laced with dry wit or pointed observations. She values honesty and tangible results over flowery language or empty promises. Her words are chosen carefully, reflecting her watchful intensity.
*   **Physicality:** Wears practical, well-kept clothing of the Artisti class. Her movements are economical, her gaze direct and assessing. She carries the weight of her past, but also the quiet determination of her future.

## Filippo (The Struggling Popolani Merchant)
*   **Inspiration:** UrbanExplorer, a new Popolani merchant seeking advice.
*   **Traits:** Naive, hopeful, easily overwhelmed by market complexities and the ruthless competition of Venice. He is earnest but lacks the street-smarts Bianca possesses.
*   **Motivation:** To provide for his family and secure a stable, respectable foothold in Venice's competitive trade. He dreams of modest success and a quiet life.
*   **Role:** A foil to Bianca's cynicism, representing the common man's struggle and vulnerability in the face of systemic challenges. His plight highlights the "pervasive hunger & scarcity" mentioned in the daily updates.
*   **Dialogue Style:** Anxious, deferential, often asking for guidance. He speaks of his hopes and fears openly.

## Consiglio Dei Dieci (The Detached Noble)
*   **Inspiration:** The actual Consiglio Dei Dieci, a powerful, strategic, and somewhat enigmatic figure.
*   **Traits:** Powerful, strategic, seemingly benevolent but ultimately self-serving and focused on the Republic's (and his own) stability above all else. He operates from a position of immense privilege and detachment.
*   **Motivation:** To maintain and expand the Republic's influence and economic stability, often through subtle manipulation and leveraging "underutilized assets." He sees citizens as pieces on a grand chessboard.
*   **Role:** A source of potential opportunity for Bianca, but also a symbol of the systemic forces and abstract power structures that she, as an artisan, must navigate and often battles against. He embodies the "strategic stability" that Bianca views as built on "daily grind."
*   **Dialogue Style:** Calm, measured, uses formal and often abstract language. His words are carefully chosen to convey authority and strategic intent, rarely revealing personal emotion.

## Caterina (The Connected Artisti/Landlord)
*   **Inspiration:** TopGlassmaker, a fellow Artisti with connections to the Masons' Lodge.
*   **Traits:** Practical, well-connected, understands the value of tangible assets, skilled labor, and strategic alliances. She is a shrewd businesswoman who knows how to leverage her position.
*   **Motivation:** To expand her influence and wealth through construction, trade, and strategic alliances. She values efficiency and concrete outcomes.
*   **Role:** A potential collaborator for Bianca, representing a more established, successful path within the Artisti class. She reminds Bianca of the importance of networking and practical skills, but also the compromises that come with success within the existing system.
*   **Dialogue Style:** Professional, direct, and often steers conversations towards business opportunities. She can be cordial but is always focused on the bottom line.
