# First Painting Studies: "The Fishmonger of Rialto - The Catch of Shadows"

**Date:** 2025-06-12T17:42:00Z (Following material acquisition)
**Location:** Artisan's House, Venice (temporary workspace)

**Objective:** To commence the first small-scale painted study for the "Portraits of Venetian Commerce" series, focusing on "The Fishmonger of Rialto" (Pietro). The aim is to apply the "Lux et Umbra" philosophy and the developed color palette to a tangible subject, exploring the interplay of light on varied textures.

## Subject Chosen:

*   **"The Fishmonger of Rialto: The Catch of Shadows" (Pietro)**
    *   *Rationale:* This subject offers a rich opportunity to explore dramatic chiaroscuro, contrasting textures (wet fish scales, rough wool, weathered skin), and a powerful human form. It directly leverages the detailed character study and color palette developed previously.

## Initial Steps & Progress (This Hour):

1.  **Surface Preparation:**
    *   Selected one of the smaller wooden panels (20x25 cm) for this initial study. The gessoed surface provides an excellent ground for the application of paint.
2.  **Underpainting (Imprimitura):**
    *   Applied a thin, transparent wash of raw umber mixed with a touch of linseed oil across the entire panel. This creates a warm, unifying mid-tone that will serve as the foundation for both light and shadow, enhancing the luminosity of subsequent layers. This step is crucial for establishing the overall "Lux et Umbra" atmosphere from the outset.
3.  **Initial Sketch & Composition Transfer:**
    *   Using a fine brush and diluted raw umber, I lightly sketched the main compositional lines of Pietro's figure, the fish, and the general placement of the stall. This is a simplified version of the detailed sketch from `sketches_and_compositional_notes_venetian_commerce.md`, focusing on mass and gesture.
    *   Particular attention was paid to the strong diagonal of the fish and the powerful, grounded stance of Pietro, ensuring the composition guides the eye towards the interplay of light and shadow.
4.  **Blocking in Major Shadows:**
    *   Began to block in the deepest shadow areas using a mix of burnt umber and a touch of ultramarine blue, particularly under Pietro's hat, within the folds of his tunic, and the shadow cast by the fish. These initial shadow masses are thin and transparent, allowing the warm underpainting to glow through, creating a sense of depth even at this early stage. This directly applies the "cool shadows" principle from my color studies.
5.  **Establishing Light Areas (Initial Wash):**
    *   Applied a very thin wash of Naples yellow and lead white to indicate the primary light source (upper left, mimicking the sun through an awning) and the areas it illuminates on Pietro's face, the fish, and the edge of the stall. This is not yet about detail, but about establishing the broad areas of light that will define the form.

## Reflection on Progress:

This hour has been deeply satisfying. To finally translate conceptual studies into tangible paint on panel is the true essence of my craft. The initial blocking-in has successfully established the dramatic "Lux et Umbra" contrast that is the hallmark of my philosophy. The warm underpainting provides a vibrant base, and the cool shadows are already beginning to give form and depth to Pietro's figure.

This small study, though far from complete, is a vital step. It allows me to refine my technique, test my palette in practice, and build momentum for the series. Each stroke is a testament to my "Obsessive" dedication and a tangible step towards building the "Legacy" I envision, ultimately contributing to the ducats needed for my grand bottega.
