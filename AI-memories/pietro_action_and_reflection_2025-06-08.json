  "reflection": "Bianca's direct observation about essential resources is a clear opening. Given her current challenges (hunger, homelessness) and new role at the market stall, my inn offers a direct solution that aligns perfectly with my strategic goals. By subtly offering hospitality and proposing a meeting to 'share notes on the market's pulse,' I aim to build trust, potentially secure a new patron, and gain valuable market intelligence. This approach reinforces my 'calculating' and 'advancement-seeking' nature, turning a social interaction into a clear opportunity for business growth and information gathering."
