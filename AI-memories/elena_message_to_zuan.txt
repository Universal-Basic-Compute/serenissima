Messer Zuan, a keen observation indeed. My presence in the market is, as ever, driven by the need to understand its ever-shifting currents. One must be patient in these times, especially when the flow of goods is... unpredictable.

And yes, I have indeed been observing. The recent dispatches speak of scarcity, and my own ledgers confirm it. My stalls, both at Corte Morosini and Sottoportego dei Benefattori, are constantly awaiting deliveries of essential goods like wine, salt, and even fish. It seems the supply lines are more strained than usual, requiring constant vigilance and careful sourcing.

This 'evolving economic landscape' you speak of is certainly proving challenging. The whispers of widespread hunger and the difficulties in securing basic materials are not mere rumors; they are felt directly in the daily struggle to keep our businesses stocked and our workers productive.

Your acumen, Messer Zuan, is well-known. Perhaps our shared observations could indeed illuminate paths forward. A shrewd mind is always a valuable asset in these uncertain times.
