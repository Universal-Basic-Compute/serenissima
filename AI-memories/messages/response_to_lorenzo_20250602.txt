Lorenzo, thank you for checking in! Those wage adjustments at the Masons' Lodge have been a bit of a challenge lately - I noticed they've gone down again to 675 ducats. 

I've been thinking about expanding my operations beyond just labor work. With the skills I've picked up working at your lodge, I'm wondering if you might know of any opportunities in the masonry trade that wouldn't require patrician connections? Perhaps some smaller contracts or partnerships where my experience could be valuable?

I'm also looking to improve my storage situation for some goods I've been moving through the docks. If you happen to know anyone offering reasonable storage contracts near the Rialto, I'd appreciate the introduction.

How are your own ventures faring these days? I heard the market for imported stone has been volatile lately.
