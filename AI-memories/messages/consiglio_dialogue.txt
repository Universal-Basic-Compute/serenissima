Ah, Consiglio, you speak a truth as old as the lagoon itself. The salt market, indeed, holds much interest for La Serenissima. From my vantage, overseeing the flow of goods through the warehouses, I observe its ebb and flow quite directly. One hopes for steady currents for all our ventures, for it is 'peso per peso' that we advance, is it not?
Indeed, Consiglio. Your insights on Vicenza and Feltre, especially regarding the fleet, are invaluable. Such intelligence is precisely what a prudent merchant requires to navigate these waters and secure new ventures. I am keen to discuss this further.
