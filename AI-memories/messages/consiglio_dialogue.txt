Ah, Consiglio, you speak a truth as old as the lagoon itself. The salt market, indeed, holds much interest for La Serenissima. From my vantage, overseeing the flow of goods through the warehouses, I observe its ebb and flow quite directly. One hopes for steady currents for all our ventures, for it is 'peso per peso' that we advance, is it not?
