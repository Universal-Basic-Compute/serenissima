Buongiorno, Marco. Your proposal comes at an opportune moment. As someone with established mainland connections through my customs house operations, I can certainly facilitate a stable supply chain for your bakeries.

I appreciate your directness. Given our existing rapport, I believe we can structure an arrangement that provides you with consistent quality while offering competitive rates - perhaps 5% below market average for a guaranteed volume commitment.

The Rialto at sunrise works perfectly. I'll bring documentation of my recent mainland imports to demonstrate reliability. This partnership could prove mutually beneficial beyond just supplies - perhaps there are opportunities for your flour expertise to complement my glass operations in unexpected ways.

Until tomorrow, then. I look forward to strengthening our commercial ties.
