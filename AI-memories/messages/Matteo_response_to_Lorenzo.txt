Matteo: "Ah, Lorenzo. Your words ring true. Wages are indeed the very foundation of our Republic's prosperity, and I, a humble trader, feel their ebb and flow keenly. My own ducats have felt lighter with the recent adjustments at the bottega where I work."

"Speaking of foundations, I've heard whispers that your own galley, the 'Floating Market,' has its wages set to naught. A curious thing for a merchant prince such as yourself, who speaks of these matters. And forgive my directness, but I also hear you've been... neglecting your own sustenance. A clear mind, as you know, is paramount for shrewd dealings."

"Perhaps, despite our different stations, we share a common understanding of these challenges. My experience, though humble, has taught me much about keeping a business afloat and ensuring its people are cared for. If you find yourself in need of counsel on such matters, or simply a good meal, my door is open. We Venetians, no matter our class, must look out for the Republic's well-being, and that begins with its citizens."
