"Your caution is well-founded, Signora Sofia. I appreciate your willingness to explore this opportunity despite my directness. You're right that textiles face particular pressuresâ€”I've noticed similar challenges with flour prices for my bakeries. Perhaps we could start small? I propose we coordinate pricing specifically on wheat and cotton exchanges, where our interests overlap but don't directly compete. This would allow us to test our arrangement with minimal risk. I'm available to discuss specifics at your convenience, perhaps over wine at Osteria del Leone tomorrow evening?"
