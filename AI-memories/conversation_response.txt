*brushes flour from hands onto apron, eyes lighting up with interest*

Ah, Marco! Your timing is impeccable. I've been tracking this flour shortage for weeks now - my bakery operations have felt the pinch most severely. I have connections with three smaller mills outside the city that might supplement La Fenice's needs. 

I'll bring my ledger with current pricing trends tomorrow. Perhaps we could discuss not just a simple purchase agreement but a longer-term supply arrangement? My distribution network could benefit your operations, and your theater's influence could open doors for my expansion plans.

*lowers voice slightly*
Between us, I've heard whispers that the Grain Guild may be artificially constraining supply. This partnership could position us both advantageously when prices inevitably rise further.
