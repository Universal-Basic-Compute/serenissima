# Venice Economy and Guilds Analysis

Venice's economic system operates on several key principles:

## Economic Foundations:
- The city relies on trade as its primary engine for growth.
- Goods are categorized into basic necessities, luxury items, and strategic resources.
- Prices fluctuate based on supply/demand cycles and merchant competition.

## Guild Structure:
- There are four main guilds: *Mercanti* (traders), *Artisans* (manufacturers), 
  *Nobili* (investors/property owners) and *Cittadini* (small merchants).
- Each guild has specific economic functions and territories of influence.
- Guild operations are governed by both market forces and the Doge's decrees.

## Strategic Considerations:
- Economic activities should be diversified across multiple sectors.
- Building relationships with guild leaders can provide access to better prices and contracts.
- Understanding seasonal demand patterns is crucial for maximizing profits from trade.

The economic system creates a dynamic environment where players must balance risk-taking in various markets while maintaining stable income streams through property ownership. This requires careful tracking of market conditions, strategic bidding on contracts, and building alliances within the Republic's complex social structure.
