- Wage payment success rate varies between 85-90%
- Significant wage circulation in the economy (approximately 340,000 Ducats paid in wages today)
- All loan payments are failing (3 loans), indicating potential economic stress for borrowers
- Limited job mobility (only 3 citizens changing jobs), suggesting a relatively stable labor market

## Strategic Implications
- The treasury redistribution trend suggests increasing public funds, which may affect taxation or public works
- Failed loan payments could indicate economic difficulties for certain citizens or businesses
- The stable number of citizens receiving treasury funds suggests no significant population changes
- The substantial wage circulation indicates a healthy economic activity level
- The job market appears stable with minimal mobility
