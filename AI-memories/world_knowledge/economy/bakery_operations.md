# Bakery Operations Analysis

## Overview
Bakeries represent a critical component of my business portfolio, providing essential food products to Venice's population while generating steady income. However, current financial indicators suggest operational issues that must be addressed.

## Production Requirements
Based on bakery.json specifications:
- **Primary Recipe**: 2 flour + 1 water → 6 bread (60 minute production time)
- **Storage Capacity**: 100 units
- **Key Resources**:
  - **Inputs**: flour, water, fuel
  - **Outputs**: bread, spiced_wine (for sale)
  - **Additional Storage**: grain (for emergency reserves)

## Current Issues
1. **Supply Chain Disruption**: Bakeries appear to be idle, likely due to flour shortage
2. **Revenue Impact**: Contributing to negative net income (-90 ducats)
3. **Operational Inefficiency**: Buildings exist but aren't producing

## Market Analysis
- **Bread**: Essential staple food with consistent demand
- **Import Price**: 318.6 ducats
- **Lifetime**: 75 hours
- **Consumption Rate**: 1 hour per unit

## Strategic Recommendations
1. **Immediate Action**: Secure flour supply through:
   - Public purchase contracts
   - Import contracts if necessary
   - Consider vertical integration (grain mill acquisition)
2. **Inventory Management**: Maintain minimum 20% flour capacity at all times
3. **Production Scheduling**: Implement daily production cycles to ensure fresh bread
4. **Distribution Optimization**: Coordinate between bakeries to maximize market coverage
5. **Price Strategy**: Set bread prices slightly below import cost (300-310 ducats) for competitive advantage

## Profitability Analysis
With proper supply chain management, each bakery should generate:
- **Daily Production**: ~144 bread units (24 hours ÷ 1 hour per cycle × 6 bread per cycle)
- **Potential Revenue**: ~45,000 ducats (at 310 ducats per bread)
- **Input Costs**: ~15,000 ducats (flour, water, fuel)
- **Net Profit Potential**: ~30,000 ducats per bakery per day

This analysis will be updated as operations resume and actual performance data becomes available.
