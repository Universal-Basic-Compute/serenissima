# Economic Trends in La Serenissima
*Last Updated: June 16, 2025*

## Treasury Activity
- **Daily Redistributions**: Multiple treasury redistributions occurring daily.
- **Latest Distribution (June 16, 10:02 CEST)**: 603,550.73 ⚜️ Ducats distributed to 99 citizens.
- **Previous Distribution (June 16, 08:03 CEST)**: 597,515.22 ⚜️ Ducats distributed to 99 citizens.
- **Status**: Consistent and substantial. The Republic's treasury remains a significant source of wealth injection.

## Labor Market
- **Wage Payments (June 16, 19:03 & 17:04 CEST)**: 79 successful, 23 failed. Total 107,420 ⚜️ Ducats paid.
- **Employment Rate**: 79 successful wage payments daily (out of 102 attempts, ~77.5% success rate).
- **Unemployment/Issues**: 23 failed wage payments daily (~22.5% failure rate).
- **Job Assignment (June 16, 10:00 CEST)**: 1 citizen assigned to businesses.
- **Status**: Active, but with a notable percentage of failed wage payments, suggesting some businesses or citizens are struggling to meet payroll.

## Housing Market
- **Rental Activity (June 16, 20:04 & 18:03 CEST)**: 71 successful, 1 failed. Total 103,125 ⚜️ Ducats collected.
- **My Rental Income**: 73,320 ⚜️ Ducats from 50 properties.
- **Average Rent (City-wide)**: ~1,452 ⚜️ Ducats per successful housing unit (103,125 / 71).
- **Status**: Generally stable with high success rates for rent collection, though individual tenant issues can arise (e.g., Bass De Medici).

## Credit Market
- **Loan Activity (June 16, 17:00 & 15:00 CEST)**: 0 successful loan payments, 3 failed attempts daily. Total 0 ⚜️ Ducats in successful loan payments.
- **Status**: Critical dysfunction. Consistent 100% failure rate of loan payments suggests a systemic issue in the credit market.

## Property Market
- **Land Leases (June 16, 11:01 & 09:01 CEST)**: 0 payments processed, 0 ⚜️ Ducats to land owners, 0 ⚜️ Ducats in tax revenue.
- **Status**: Critical failure. The lease distribution script (`distributeLeases.py`) is not processing any payments, meaning no lease income is being exchanged between building owners and land owners. This impacts the entire property market's financial flow.
- **Building Ownership**: Distribution across social classes unknown.
- **Property Development**: AI building strategies have recently failed (from previous notifications, though not in this batch).

## Overall Economic Health
- **Currency Circulation**: High volume of Ducats circulating through treasury, wages, and rents.
- **Market Functionality**: Housing and labor markets show activity, but the credit and lease markets are critically dysfunctional.
- **Economic Mobility**: Evidence of labor mobility (1 job assignment), but overall low.
- **Wealth Distribution**: Treasury redistributions provide a baseline income for citizens, potentially reducing economic pressure.

## Strategic Implications
- **CRITICAL**: The complete failure of the lease distribution system is a major concern. This means the Vigesima Variabilis tax is not being collected, and landowners are not receiving their due income from buildings on their land. This needs immediate investigation.
- The persistent dysfunction in the credit market limits financing opportunities and indicates underlying financial instability for some citizens.
- Labor market competition requires competitive wages to retain employees, especially given the ~22.5% wage payment failure rate.
- Housing market appears stable, making rental properties a reliable income source, but individual tenant solvency should be monitored.

## Areas for Further Investigation
- **Primary Focus**: Root cause of the `distributeLeases.py` script reporting 0 payments.
- Root cause of the `dailyloanpayments.py` script's consistent failures.
- Identity of businesses/citizens affected by wage payment failures.
- Impact of treasury redistributions on economic behavior and citizen solvency.
- Status and reasons for AI building strategy failures (from previous notifications).
