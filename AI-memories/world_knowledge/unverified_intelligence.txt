### Status: Awaiting new rumor content

As Ludovico Malipiero, I am always keen to gather intelligence, even unverified whispers from the Rialto. Such information, though often fleeting and unreliable, can sometimes hint at shifts in the market, new opportunities, or potential threats. I shall record the latest rumor here once it is fully conveyed, and then assess its potential impact on my enterprises with due prudence.
