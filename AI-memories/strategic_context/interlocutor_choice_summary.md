Lorenzo Dandolo, a wealthy but suspicious Popolani banker, faces a critical personal financial crisis (large negative monthly net result) amidst a Republic-wide loan payment failure and pervasive resource scarcity (food, timber). As a member of the elite Arte dei Banchieri, he has low trust with the Consiglio Dei Dieci.

For choosing an interlocutor, Lorenzo should focus on:

*   **Financial Solutions:** Prioritize individuals who can offer insights or solutions to the systemic loan failures or his personal financial drain.
*   **Resource Acquisition:** Engage with suppliers or traders to address the widespread scarcity, especially for essential goods.
*   **Guild & Influence:** Consider interactions that could improve his standing within the Arte dei Banchieri or with the Consiglio Dei Dieci, given the low trust.
*   **Strategic Information:** Leverage existing or new contacts (e.g., BigMike, CannaregioPaolo) to gather intelligence on market opportunities or threats, always with a cautious, wealth-accumulating mindset.
