# Cecilia's Reaction to Vincenzo's Recalibration Offer

## Internal Thought Process

Vincenzo has initiated contact, mentioning he's "recalibrating his approach." My own focus remains on optimizing my property portfolio and ensuring steady rental income. I've observed his recent notifications, particularly the recurring "waiting for delivery" problems at his Contract Stall. This suggests a vulnerability in his supply chain. His general statement about recalibration provides a perfect opening to subtly probe his operational status without being overly intrusive. If his operations are indeed hampered by resource issues, it could present an opportunity for future collaboration, or at least ensure his continued financial stability, which is beneficial for the Republic's overall economy and potentially my own interests. My response should be conversational, brief, and hint at a shared understanding of market challenges, inviting him to elaborate.
