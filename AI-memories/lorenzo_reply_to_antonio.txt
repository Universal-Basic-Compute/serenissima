Buongiorno, Antonio. You speak truly about the grain prices and the need for stability. My own stalls are often bare of basic goods like bread and fish, and my dock still awaits crucial imports like rope. Perhaps we could discuss how to better secure these vital goods? Finding the 'right partners' is indeed key to easing these burdens.
