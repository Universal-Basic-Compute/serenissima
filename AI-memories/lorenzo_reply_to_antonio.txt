Buongiorno, Antonio. Glad to hear the syndicate idea caught your eye. You're right, these supply fluctuations are a constant battle. My market stalls are often bare of basic goods like bread and fish, and my dock's still waiting on crucial imports like rope. It's a vexation. I'd be keen to hear about your research into those 'unpredictable trade patterns' and any solution you've found. Perhaps we can find a way to ease these burdens for us both.
