Buongiorno, Antonio. You speak truly about the warehouses; a good Popolani knows how to make a ducat stretch, and these structures are indeed cost-effective. And you're right, the true art is in securing the right resources. I've got plenty of contracts for grain, fish, and other goods for my stalls, but it seems the galleys are taking their sweet time arriving. It's a constant battle to keep the shelves stocked, even with all the ducats in the world. How do you manage to keep your high-value wheat flowing so smoothly? Any shortcuts for a fellow merchant?
