Antonio, *buon giorno*. You speak of tensions near the Ducal Palace, and I've certainly felt the ripples of it in the markets. Whispers of the Doge's intervention and challenges to his authority... it makes a man like me, who deals in tangible goods, quite uneasy. You're right to be cautious with investments in Cannaregio; the recent decree on public buildings has put a strain on many, myself included, with my own managed dock and stalls.

My own concerns are more immediate, I confess. My contract stalls at Fondamenta delle Zattere and Ruga dei Conciapelli are crying out for wine, salt, flour, fish, olives, olive oil, preserved fish, and even bread. It seems the supply lines are more tangled than a fisherman's net after a storm, and my employees are feeling the pinch of hunger, which affects their work.

You, with your keen eye for discretion and your sources, might have a clearer view of how these political currents are truly affecting the flow of goods. Have your sources, perhaps Signore Bartolomeo, shed any light on how a man might secure reliable provisions in these uncertain times? Any shortcuts to keep the ducats flowing and the bellies full, without getting caught in the patrician squabbles?
