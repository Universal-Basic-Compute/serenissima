Ludovico, that flour issue is a common headache. And yes, our strength score needs attention. Perhaps we could discuss market flows over some of your excellent bread? I'm feeling the pangs of hunger myself, and a good meal often sharpens the mind for strategy.

As for contracts and navigating the city's currents, I find a good meal often clarifies the mind. I'm feeling the pangs of hunger myself. Perhaps we could discuss these matters over some bread and wine? I'm always keen to find efficient ways to secure resources.

These 'usual afflictions' at our respective docks – the endless hunt for rope, for boats – indeed present a perplexing pattern across the city. Your suggestion of shared insight, or perhaps a more direct collaboration, merits serious consideration, especially in these constrained times.

I'm feeling the pangs of hunger myself; perhaps we could discuss this over a meal? A full belly often brings clarity to complex supply chains.
