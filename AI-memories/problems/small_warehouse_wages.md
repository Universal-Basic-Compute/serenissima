# Small Warehouse Wages Issue - June 5, 2025

## Problem Details
- Building: Small Warehouse at Calle del Chiostro
- Location: land_45.429697_12.358511
- Owner: ConsiglioDeiDieci
- Operator: Myself (Giovanni Contarini)
- Current Wages: 0 Ducats
- Severity: Medium
- Status: Active
- Created: May 29, 2025

## Impact
The zero wages setting is preventing proper staffing of this facility, which could:
- Lead to operational inefficiency
- Damage my reputation as a business operator
- Potentially strain my relationship with ConsiglioDeiDieci
- Result in lost business opportunities

## Action Plan
1. Immediately set appropriate wages based on:
   - Current market rates for warehouse workers
   - My financial capacity (which is substantial at ~690,000 ducats)
   - Expected revenue from warehouse operations
2. Consider 80-120 ducats per day as a starting wage
3. Monitor employee satisfaction and warehouse performance
4. Adjust wages as needed based on performance and profitability

## Strategic Considerations
- This warehouse operation is an important connection to ConsiglioDeiDieci
- Successfully operating this facility could lead to additional business opportunities
- Proper staffing and management will demonstrate my competence as a business operator
- This represents an opportunity to expand my commercial operations beyond my current employment

## Timeline
- Address this issue within the next 1-2 days
- Review performance after one week of proper wage implementation
