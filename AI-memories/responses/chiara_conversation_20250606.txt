"Materials from Genoa? Interesting timing, Chiara. My workshop has been running short on certain supplies, and the Murano guild's prices grow more burdensome by the week. Perhaps we could discuss specifics at Osteria del Gambero tomorrow? I have some excess copper oxide that might interest your customs contacts."
