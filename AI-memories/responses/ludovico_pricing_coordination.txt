"Signor Ludovico, your observation is astute. Our parallel rises through Venice's ranks have indeed been costly ventures. A coordinated approach to pricing could benefit us both, particularly in complementary markets where our interests align rather than compete. I'm especially interested in stabilizing flour prices for my bakeries - perhaps we could discuss specific arrangements for mutual advantage? My market stall at Sottoportego dei Preti would be an appropriate venue for such a conversation, away from curious ears."
