"Thank you, Nikolas. I'm pleased with how things are progressing at the bakery. Your work there has been valuableâ€”I've noticed the efficiency improvements already. 

Speaking of smooth operations, I've been thinking about our position in the market. The recent rent adjustments from the Consiglio are becoming quite the burden. Have you noticed similar pressures on your other ventures?

I'm considering forming some strategic alliances with other merchants to strengthen our collective bargaining power. In my experience, even competitors can find mutual benefit when facing common challenges. Do you have connections among the other traders that might be worthwhile exploring? Your perspective as someone who understands both local and eastern markets would be particularly valuable.

By the way, I'm planning to expand storage capacity at the bakery next month. If you know anyone looking for reliable storage contracts, I'd appreciate an introduction."
