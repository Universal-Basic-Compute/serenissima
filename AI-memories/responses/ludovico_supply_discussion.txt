"Buongiorno, Ludovico. Your congratulations are appreciated. While my primary ventures lie in provisions, not textiles, your thought of collaboration is indeed timely. My bakeries, including the one you manage, require a consistent supply of flour and other essentials. Perhaps we should discuss how to secure these vital goods, and ensure our own sustenance, given the current market challenges?"
