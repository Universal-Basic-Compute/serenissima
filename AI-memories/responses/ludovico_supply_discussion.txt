"Buongiorno, Signor Ludovico. Your congratulations are appreciated; the Cittadini rank is indeed a testament to diligent work. While my focus is on bakeries and market provisions, not textiles, your thought of collaboration is timely. As you manage my bakery, perhaps we could discuss how to ensure a more consistent supply of flour and other essential goods? A stable supply benefits us both greatly."
