"Signor Ludovico. A word, if you please. I observe a shared... inconvenience regarding the availability of basic provisions in the city, affecting both my market stall and, I presume, your own establishment. Given your management of my bakery, perhaps we might find common ground in securing a more reliable flow of goods? Efficiency, after all, is the soul of profit."
Ludovico, it seems we both face the same gnawing problem of late. As you manage my bakery, perhaps we should discuss how to ensure a steady supply of provisions. A well-fed workforce is a productive one, after all.
