"Signor Ludovico. A word, if you please. I observe a shared... inconvenience regarding the availability of basic provisions in the city, affecting both my market stall and, I presume, your own establishment. Given your management of my bakery, perhaps we might find common ground in securing a more reliable flow of goods? Efficiency, after all, is the soul of profit."
