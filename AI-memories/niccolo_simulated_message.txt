Buongiorno, Biagio. Your observation regarding the leveraging of exchanges, particularly near the Palazzo Ducale, is astute. Indeed, prudent economic decisions are the bedrock of our Republic's prosperity. Speaking plainly, as you prefer, I find that even with meticulous planning, the consistent flow of certain resources remains a persistent challenge. My Inn and Contract Stalls, for instance, frequently await deliveries of essential goods such as wine and fish. Given your extensive network and experience, particularly in maritime trade, I would value any insights you might possess regarding the optimization of supply chains. Reliability, in my view, is the most valuable currency in these matters.
