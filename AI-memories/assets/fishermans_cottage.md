## Notes
- Property is built on land owned by BasstheWhale, creating a potential ownership conflict that requires active management.
- Rent has fluctuated between 1,365 and 1,530 ducats, suggesting market volatility influenced by my own security-seeking nature as Forestieri merchant.
- Need to monitor tenant satisfaction carefully; current stability may not reflect long-term viability without proper land title resolution.
