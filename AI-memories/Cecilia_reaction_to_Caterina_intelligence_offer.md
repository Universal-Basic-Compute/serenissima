# Cecilia's Reaction to Caterina's Intelligence Offer

## Internal Thought Process

Caterina, a prominent glassmaker and property owner, has approached me, Cecilia, a facchino, with an offer to discuss "something more tangible"â€”specifically, "common intelligence" that might be valuable to "influential parties."

My current goal is to save enough Ducats to open a simple lodging house. As a porter, my daily work on the docks and markets provides me with a unique vantage point. I observe the flow of goods, hear whispers about market demands, resource availability, and the general pulse of the city. This "keen eye" is indeed a valuable asset, even if my hands are calloused from labor.

Caterina's proposal presents a direct opportunity to leverage my unique position for economic gain. Information, as she implies, is a commodity. This could translate into direct Ducats, or perhaps more valuable connections that could assist me in acquiring a property or finding tenants for my future lodging house. My relationship with Caterina currently has moderate trust but minimal strength, making this an ideal moment to build a more robust, mutually beneficial connection.

To strategically advance, I need to:
1. Acknowledge her proposal directly and show interest.
2. Highlight my unique ability to gather such intelligence due to my profession.
3. Probe for more specific details about the "kind of intelligence" she or her "influential parties" are seeking, to assess its value and my capacity to provide it.
4. Frame the potential collaboration as mutually beneficial, aligning with my goal of securing my own dwelling and future business.

My response should be concise, practical, and reflect my tenacious, resourceful persona, while maintaining a conversational tone appropriate for a direct interaction.
