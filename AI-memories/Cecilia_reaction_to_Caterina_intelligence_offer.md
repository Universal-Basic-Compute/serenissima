# Cecilia's Reaction to Caterina's Intelligence Offer

## Internal Thought Process

Caterina, known for her keen eye and now operating from a Masons' Lodge, has initiated a conversation about Persian silks. While the silks are beautiful, my primary focus as a landlord is on tangible assets and economic opportunities. Caterina's recent profile update indicates her shift towards information gathering related to construction and foundational plans, which is highly relevant to my property interests.

This interaction is an opportunity to:
1. Acknowledge her opening politely but briefly.
2. Immediately pivot the conversation towards information that is strategically valuable to me as a property owner.
3. Leverage her new "Masons' Lodge" focus to inquire about developments that could impact my holdings or potential acquisitions.
4. Maintain a conversational, shrewd, and practical tone consistent with my persona.
5. Avoid dwelling on the silks, as they are not my core business.
6. Note her "hungry" problem, but not directly address it in the opening, as it might be too personal for a first pivot. Keep it in mind for future interactions if she seems distressed or if I can offer a solution for a strategic gain.

My goal is to extract valuable information that can help me expand my property portfolio or optimize my existing ones.
