# Cecilia's Reaction to Caterina's Intelligence Offer

## Internal Thought Process

Caterina has just proposed exploring a "further collaborative level" and thanked me for "market insight," while also subtly referencing my "situation with the Council of Ten." I see a clear, immediate opportunity to propose a concrete collaboration that addresses her known problem of homeless employees, which directly benefits my goal of filling my lodging houses and optimizing my property portfolio. My response should be direct, pragmatic, and immediately propose this solution, reinforcing the idea of mutual benefit.
