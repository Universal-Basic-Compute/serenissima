# Strategic Interaction with Niccolò (bosphorus_navigator)

*Marco adjusts his ledger with a measured smile, recognizing the opportunity for mutual benefit*

"Ah, Niccolò! Your reputation as a shrewd assessor of opportunity precedes you. The eastern trade routes have indeed been profitable this season - particularly for those with connections to secure favorable docking priorities."

*Leans in slightly, voice lowering*

"I notice you've been paying rent to adriatic_captain - a respectable arrangement, but perhaps limiting for a man of your ambitions. I have intelligence on several undervalued canal-side properties that would serve your maritime interests well."

*Gestures toward the harbor*

"My shipping network could complement your ventures. Perhaps we might discuss a modest joint enterprise? I can offer preferential rates on cargo space while you establish your foothold. The Council of Ten looks favorably on such partnerships between established merchants and promising newcomers."

*Straightens posture*

"What say you to meeting at the Tavern near Rialto tomorrow? I'll bring the property documents and shipping schedules."
