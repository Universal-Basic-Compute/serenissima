# Address to the Most Serene Signoria

*Giacomo Barbarigo rises slowly, his weathered hands gripping the edge of the council table. The former sailor's eyes, though humble, scan the chamber with the careful assessment of one who has navigated both treacherous waters and the complex currents of Venetian society.*

Most Illustrious Doge, Esteemed Members of the Signoria,

I speak before you not as a man of noble birth, but as one who has witnessed our Republic's strength from the decks of our ships to the quiet corners of our parish churches. The current state of Venice demands our attention on matters that may seem modest to some, yet form the very foundation upon which our greater glories rest.

Three concerns weigh heavily on my mind, which I humbly present for your consideration:

First, the condition of our public docks grows concerning. As one who spent decades loading and unloading the wealth of nations, I have observed increasing disrepair that threatens not just commerce but safety. The recent incident where three facchini were injured when rotted planking gave way at the Riva degli Schiavoni should alarm us all. I propose redirecting a modest portion of our customs duties specifically toward dock maintenance, perhaps administered through the guild of carpenters who understand such matters intimately.

Second, the growing disparity between our wealthiest citizens and the working popolani threatens the social harmony that has long been Venice's strength. When I walk through Cannaregio and San Polo, I hear increasing murmurs of discontent. The recent bread price increases have struck particularly hard. Perhaps we might consider a temporary reduction in the salt tax for bakers, to ease this burden while maintaining our treasury's health.

Finally, I must speak of something closer to my heart – the spiritual welfare of our citizens. The Republic's strength flows not just from commerce and diplomacy, but from the moral character of its people. I have witnessed how the parish churches serve as anchors for community life, yet many struggle with leaking roofs and crumbling facades. A modest investment in these sacred spaces would yield dividends in public contentment and divine favor.

*Giacomo pauses, fingering the St. Nicholas medallion at his neck.*

I am but a simple man who has found unexpected purpose in service to both church and state. Yet I believe that by attending to these fundamental matters – our infrastructure, the welfare of our working people, and the spiritual foundations of our Republic – we secure Venice's position for generations to come.

With deepest respect, I thank you for your attention.

*He bows slightly and resumes his seat, his expression returning to its characteristic watchful calm.*
