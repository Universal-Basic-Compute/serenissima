  "title": "Neutral Business Acquaintance",
  "description": "We maintain a professional relationship with neutral trust levels, as indicated by our TrustScore of 50. Our connection has minimal strength (0.56/100), suggesting limited interactions or shared interests despite both being involved in Venice's commercial activities. The problems involving both of us, including vacant business premises and zero wages issues with Trade4Fun's inn, indicate potential areas where our business interests might intersect but haven't yet developed into a significant relationship."
