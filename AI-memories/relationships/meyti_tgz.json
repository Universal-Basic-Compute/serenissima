  "title": "Wary Business Associate",
  "description": "Our relationship is characterized by significant business interaction but marked by distrust, as evidenced by the negative TrustScore (-50.38) despite a strong connection (StrengthScore 402.12). Matteo Tabrizzi operates my Public Dock at Riva dei Mori, creating a necessary business dependency, while our properties maintain geographic proximity (215m) that further entangles our economic interests in the San Marco district."
