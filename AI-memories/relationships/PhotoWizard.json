  "title": "Neutral Business Acquaintance",
  "description": "We maintain a professional, arms-length relationship characterized by cautious neutrality rather than deep trust or distrust. Our connection is extremely weak (0.6/100 strength), suggesting minimal interaction or shared interests despite both being members of the same merchant guild. As fellow traders with complementary positions in Venice's commercial hierarchy—myself as an established contract broker and Lucrezia as an ambitious dock worker managing a small warehouse—we recognize each other's existence but have yet to develop any meaningful business ties or personal rapport."
