  "title": "Cautious Guild Colleagues",
  "description": "We maintain a neutral professional relationship as fellow Facchini who have risen to positions of influence within the Merchants Guild, with neither particular trust nor distrust between us. Our connection remains superficial with minimal meaningful interactions, evidenced by our low relationship strength score, suggesting we operate largely independently despite our similar backgrounds and business domains."
