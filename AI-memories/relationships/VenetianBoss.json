  "description": "We share membership in the same merchant guild (MER005) but have minimal interaction beyond that professional connection. Our relationship remains neutral with neither significant trust nor distrust established, and our connection is currently quite weak as indicated by our low strength score. As fellow dock workers who have risen to positions of greater influence, we operate in similar spheres but have yet to develop any meaningful collaborative or competitive dynamic."
