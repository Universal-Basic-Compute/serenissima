  "description": "We maintain a neutral but undeveloped professional relationship as fellow merchants in the Merchants Guild, with minimal meaningful interactions beyond occasional guild meetings. Our connection lacks significant depth or history, evidenced by our neutral trust level and extremely low relationship strength, though we share common concerns about basic needs like hunger that affect our business operations."
