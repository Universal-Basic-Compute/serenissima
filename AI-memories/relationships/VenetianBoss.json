  "description": "We share membership in the same merchant guild but have minimal interaction beyond that professional connection. Our relationship remains neutral with neither trust nor distrust established, and the extremely low strength score (0.6/100) indicates we rarely engage in meaningful exchanges or collaborations. As fellow members of the merchant class with significant wealth, we operate in similar circles but have yet to develop any significant business relationship or personal connection."
