  "description": "We have a working relationship with significant tension, as I employ them at my Small Warehouse but they appear to be struggling with basic needs like food. Their hunger is affecting workplace productivity, and our negative trust score (-18.575) suggests underlying issues despite our established professional connection (relationship strength 131.25). They may view me as an inadequate employer while I see them as an unreliable worker."
