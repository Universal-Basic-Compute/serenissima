  "description": "Our relationship is primarily defined by a business arrangement where ZenithTrader operates my Contract Stall at Calle dei Greci, creating a significant operational connection between us. While our relationship has developed some strength (140), there is currently no established trust (0), suggesting a purely transactional relationship that has been consistent but lacks deeper mutual confidence."
