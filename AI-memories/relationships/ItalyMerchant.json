  "title": "Cautious Work Colleague",
  "description": "We maintain a professional working relationship at the Public Dock at Fondamenta dei Comparetti, where I am employed under their management. Our connection is characterized by basic professional courtesy but lacks significant depth or trust beyond standard workplace interactions, with our relationship score hovering near neutral (49.25/100) and minimal strength (1.13/100) indicating limited meaningful engagement beyond our formal employer-employee arrangement."
