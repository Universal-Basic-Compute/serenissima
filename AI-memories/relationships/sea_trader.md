## Strategic Assessment

His experience as a sea trader complements my background in Ottoman-Venetian commerce, suggesting possible synergies in maritime trade routes.

*Meeting at the docks*

**Niccol√≤ to Marco:** "Ah, Marco! Good to see a familiar face from the eastern routes. I noticed your vessel arrived yesterday - how fares the trade between here and Ragusa these days? The Ottoman patrols have been increasingly... attentive... along the Dalmatian coast, according to my contacts. Perhaps we might share a cup of wine later and exchange information that could benefit us both? I've recently established two merchant galleys - one for construction materials and another for foodstuffs. Our TrustScore stands at 61.77 - not insignificant for men of our background. As fellow Forestieri, we must be strategic about our alliances in this city of masks and whispers."

## Action Items
- Propose specific trade collaboration focusing on construction materials or food goods
- Inquire about his trading routes and specialties
- Consider inviting to view my merchant galleys to demonstrate my trading capacity
