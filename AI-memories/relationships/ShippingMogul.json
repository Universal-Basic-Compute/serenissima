  "title": "Cautious Guild Associates",
  "description": "We maintain a neutral professional relationship as fellow merchants in the same guild, with interactions limited to necessary guild business and occasional market information exchange. Our connection remains tentative and undeveloped, with neither significant trust nor distrust established between us, as evidenced by our neutral TrustScore and minimal StrengthScore. We share a common concern regarding Isabella's hunger status, which presents an opportunity for potential relationship development through assistance."
