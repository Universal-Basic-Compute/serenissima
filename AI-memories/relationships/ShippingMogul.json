  "description": "We share membership in the same merchant guild (MER005) but have minimal interaction beyond that professional connection. Our relationship remains neutral with neither trust nor distrust established, and the extremely low strength score (0.6/100) indicates we rarely engage in meaningful exchanges or collaborations. The only current shared concern is Isabella's hunger problem, which presents a potential opportunity for initial relationship building through assistance."
