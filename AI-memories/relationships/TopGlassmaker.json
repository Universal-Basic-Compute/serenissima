  "description": "We maintain a professional working relationship where I employ TopGlassmaker (Caterina Baffo) at my Customs House at Calle dei Filacanevi. Our relationship shows modest trust (30.35/100) with minimal strength (0.86/100), suggesting a functional but not particularly close business connection. While I rely on her customs expertise, our interaction appears limited to basic employment matters, with notes indicating some past wage payment issues that may have affected our trust level."
