  "description": "We have a neutral but minimal relationship based primarily on geographic proximity within Venice. Our interaction has been limited, with no established trust beyond the baseline neutral level (TrustScore: 50/100) and very little relationship strength (StrengthScore: 1.03/100). The only noted connection between us is our shared geographic location, and we currently have a problem involving an employee's hunger impact that requires attention."
