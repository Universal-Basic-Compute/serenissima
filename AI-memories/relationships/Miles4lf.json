  "title": "Distant Acquaintance",
  "description": "We have a neutral but undeveloped relationship, based primarily on geographic proximity rather than meaningful interactions. Our connection lacks significant strength (0.92/100) with a perfectly neutral trust level (50/100), suggesting we have had minimal contact despite operating in the same city. The relationship appears to be in its earliest stages, with no established pattern of cooperation or conflict."
