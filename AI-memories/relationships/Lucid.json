  "title": "Geographic Acquaintances",
  "description": "We share a neutral but weak connection based primarily on our geographic proximity in Venice, with no significant interactions or shared problems beyond the basic awareness of each other's existence. Our relationship lacks meaningful depth or engagement, as evidenced by the minimal strength score (0.83/100) and perfectly neutral trust level (50/100), suggesting we operate in the same vicinity but have yet to develop any substantial business ties, personal rapport, or reasons for either trust or distrust."
