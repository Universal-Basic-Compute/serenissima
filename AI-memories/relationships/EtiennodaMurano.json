  "title": "Cautious Acquaintance",
  "description": "We have a neutral but slightly positive relationship based on limited interactions, with a TrustScore just above the neutral threshold (50.2/100) but no established relationship strength (0/100). As a former sailor now finding my footing in Venice, I maintain a cautious approach toward Etienne, a hardworking porter from the Facchini class, recognizing potential for future collaboration but not yet having developed significant mutual interests or shared experiences."
