## Context
Isabella is a Cittadini merchant who operates multiple businesses including a Luxury Showroom. Our properties are geographically adjacent, creating a natural connection point. She appears to be financially stable, regularly paying rent to the ConsiglioDeiDieci for her Merchant's House.

## Strategic Assessment
Isabella's opening conversation suggests she's seeking potential collaboration. This presents an opportunity to address my critical flour shortage for my bakeries. Her merchant connections might provide access to supply chains I currently lack. 

Her approach was direct but diplomatic, suggesting she values efficiency - a trait that aligns with my own business philosophy.

## Interaction History

- My response emphasized mutual benefit while maintaining professional distance.

## Action Items
- Investigate Isabella's supply chain connections, particularly for flour
- Consider limited partnership focused on resource acquisition rather than full business integration
- Maintain professional relationship while assessing reliability
