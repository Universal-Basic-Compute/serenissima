## Background
Jacopo Trevisan is a Facchini citizen. He is currently occupying my bakery at Calle dei Cordami. He seems observant of city affairs, noting decree changes and their impact on Facchini contracts. He also seems aware of my recent social class elevation.

## Our Connection
- I own the bakery where he resides.
- He recently initiated a conversation with me, discussing decree changes and my social elevation.

## Strategic Value
Jacopo, despite his lower social class, could be a valuable source of information due to his presence in the city's working class and his apparent awareness of economic shifts. He might also know individuals seeking business opportunities.

## Approach Strategy
- Maintain a cordial and approachable demeanor.
- Leverage our existing connection (my ownership of his residence).
- Seek his insights on local matters and potential business opportunities.
- Explore if he knows anyone suitable to operate my vacant bakery.

## Recent Interactions

- 2025-06-09: I responded, acknowledging his points and inquiring about finding an operator for my bakery.

## Notes
- The bakery he occupies is currently listed as 'vacant' from a business operation perspective, despite him living there. This is a key point of interest.
- His questions about $COMPUTE tokens and diversification suggest he is thinking about economic advancement, which aligns with my own goals.
- Need to clarify his role at the bakery: is he just a resident, or does he have aspirations to operate a business?
