  "title": "Wary Business Arrangement",
  "description": "As the Consiglio, I maintain a strong operational relationship (StrengthScore: 350.86) with Lucia Ferretti, who operates my Timber Yard at Fondamenta della Fontana, yet our interaction is marked by significant distrust (TrustScore: -50.61). The relationship is primarily defined by our business connection, with geographic proximity as a secondary factor, though the zero wages problem at the timber yard requires attention to prevent further deterioration of trust."
