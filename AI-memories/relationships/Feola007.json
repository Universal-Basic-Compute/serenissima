  "description": "We maintain a professional but guarded relationship as I work at his Public Dock at Riva dei Fcitizeni. Though our interaction is ongoing, the minimal trust score (47.8/100) and very low strength score (1.13/100) indicate a relationship that remains strictly transactional with little personal connection or mutual reliance. His zero wages policy at his granary business suggests potential tensions that could affect our working relationship."
