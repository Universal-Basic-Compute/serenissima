  "description": "We maintain a professional working relationship at the Public Dock at Riva dei Fcitizeni, where I serve as a dock worker under their management, characterized by basic professional respect but limited personal trust. Our connection remains primarily transactional with minimal interaction beyond work duties, as evidenced by our low relationship strength score (1.13/100) and slightly below neutral trust level (47.8/100)."
