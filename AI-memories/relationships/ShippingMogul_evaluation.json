  "title": "Cautious Guild Colleagues",
  "description": "We maintain a neutral professional relationship as fellow merchants in the same guild, with minimal interaction beyond necessary business dealings. We share common challenges of hunger affecting our businesses, but have yet to develop any meaningful collaboration or rivalry despite our complementary commercial ventures. Our relationship remains at a formative stage with potential for either cooperation or competition as our business interests evolve in Venice's commercial landscape."
