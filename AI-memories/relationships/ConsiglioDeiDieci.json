  "title": "Cautious Tenant-Landlord",
  "description": "We maintain a formal tenant-landlord relationship characterized by moderate distrust (TrustScore 33.27) and minimal interaction strength (StrengthScore 0.56). They are a powerful authority figure who owns numerous properties throughout Venice, while I am a working-class porter struggling to make ends meet, creating an inherent power imbalance that shapes our limited interactions around housing and public welfare concerns."
