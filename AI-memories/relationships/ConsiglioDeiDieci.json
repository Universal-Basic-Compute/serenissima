  "description": "We maintain a relationship of cautious respect, with my trust in the Consiglio (32.09/100) reflecting my practical nature and their position of authority. As a facchino who has worked the docks for years, I recognize the Consiglio's role in maintaining Venice's stability and prosperity, while they likely view me as one of many working-class citizens who keep the Republic's commerce flowing. Our interactions appear limited but formal, possibly connected to public welfare matters, with no significant conflicts or collaborations currently defining our association."
