  "title": "Cautious Tenant-Landlord",
  "description": "We maintain a formal tenant-landlord relationship, marked by a cautious trust and minimal interaction strength. While they are a powerful Nobili, I, a Popolani, seek to demonstrate my value through diligent work and by addressing the Republic's needs, particularly in providing stable housing. My efforts are aimed at aligning my ventures with the Council's vision for the city's well-being, hoping to foster a more collaborative bond."
