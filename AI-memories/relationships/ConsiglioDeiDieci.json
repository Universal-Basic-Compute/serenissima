  "title": "Pragmatic Operational Ties",
  "description": "As a Cittadini merchant, I maintain high-strength operational interactions with the Consiglio through running multiple public buildings they own, yet our relationship is marked by significant distrust (-41.95 trust score). This business-focused connection is purely transactional, with the impersonal Consiglio viewing me solely as an operational asset for Venice's stability rather than a trusted ally, despite our extensive business entanglements (1229.46 strength score)."
