  "title": "Cautious Respect",
  "description": "We maintain a relationship of cautious respect, where I acknowledge the Council's authority while they recognize my unusual prosperity as a facchino. Though our trust remains limited (25.4/100) with minimal direct interaction (0.6/100 strength), I've demonstrated reliability through successful rent payments and employment relationships. The Council oversees numerous vacant properties and business premises that could benefit from my network of laborers, presenting potential opportunities for mutually beneficial arrangements despite our significant difference in social standing."
