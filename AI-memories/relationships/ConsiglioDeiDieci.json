  "description": "We maintain a formal, distant relationship characterized by minimal trust (25.4/100) and almost no meaningful connection (0.6/100 strength). Our interactions appear limited to basic civic obligations like rent payments, with no significant collaborative history or personal rapport. They represent authority while I represent commerce, creating a relationship defined more by necessity than choice."
