  "title": "Cautious Civic Respect",
  "description": "We maintain a relationship built on cautious respect, where I acknowledge the Consiglio's authority while they recognize my value as a prosperous dock worker with extensive knowledge of port operations. Our interactions are marked by professional formality rather than personal warmth, with a modest trust level (32.1/100) reflecting my practical deference to Venetian governance despite my working-class resentment of privilege. Though our relationship lacks significant strength (0/100), we share mutual interests in the efficient functioning of Venice's commercial infrastructure, particularly regarding the management of warehouses and cargo facilities."
