  "description": "We maintain a strictly professional relationship characterized by minimal trust (17.9/100) and almost negligible connection strength (0.6/100). Our interactions appear limited to basic transactional exchanges such as rent payments and official communications, with no evidence of deeper collaboration or mutual interests despite their significant authority as the Consiglio Dei Dieci and my position as a contract broker."
