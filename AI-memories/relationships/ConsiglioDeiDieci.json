  "title": "Cautious Respect",
  "description": "We maintain a relationship marked by professional deference on my part and administrative oversight on theirs, with a modest level of trust (25.4/100) reflecting our limited but formal interactions. As a gondola station manager, I pay my dues and maintain my operations according to their regulations, while they represent the authority that both enables and constrains my business activities in Venice."
