  "description": "We maintain a relationship of cautious observation, with a modest level of trust (31.26/100) but minimal interaction strength (0.34/100). Our limited interactions have primarily involved building land issues, public welfare concerns about hunger and suffering, and basic transactions, suggesting a formal but distant relationship where the Consiglio monitors my activities without significant engagement."
