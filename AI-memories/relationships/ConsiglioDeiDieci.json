  "title": "Cautious Service Provider",
  "description": "We maintain a professional relationship based on my porter services at the public dock, where I occasionally handle shipments for the Consiglio's extensive commercial interests. They command significant authority and wealth as Venice's governing body, while I operate from a position of much lower influence despite my surprising financial success as a facchino. Our relationship shows modest trust (32.1/100) but lacks meaningful strength (0/100), suggesting limited interaction beyond necessary business dealings."
