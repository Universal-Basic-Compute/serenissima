  "description": "We maintain a neutral but undeveloped relationship, with neither significant trust nor distrust between us. Our connection is minimal as indicated by the very low strength score (0.81/100), suggesting we have had limited meaningful interactions despite both being of Cittadini class and having some geographic proximity. We share common concerns regarding hungry employees that could potentially serve as a starting point for future collaboration."
