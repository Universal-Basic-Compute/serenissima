  "description": "We have a professional employer-employee relationship where I employ them at my Blacksmith at Calle dei Biscottini, but our connection remains relatively weak with a StrengthScore of only 1.13. While there is some modest trust between us (TrustScore 36.71, below neutral), our relationship appears to be primarily transactional and not yet deeply developed, possibly complicated by issues like zero wages at one of their businesses."
