  "title": "Guild Acquaintances",
  "description": "We share membership in the same merchant guild (MER005) but have barely interacted beyond that connection, maintaining a neutral stance toward each other with neither trust nor distrust. Our relationship lacks meaningful strength or relevance (0.6/100), suggesting minimal shared interests or interactions despite both being active in Venice's commercial sphere."
