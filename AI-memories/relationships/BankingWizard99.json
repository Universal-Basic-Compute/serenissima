  "description": "We share membership in the Merchants Guild but have minimal interaction beyond that professional connection. Our relationship is perfectly neutral with neither trust nor distrust established, and the extremely low strength score (0.6/100) indicates we rarely engage with each other in meaningful ways. The only notable connection between us appears to be our guild affiliation, with no significant shared problems or opportunities that would naturally bring us together."
