  "description": "We share membership in the same merchant guild (MER005) but have minimal interaction beyond that professional connection. Our relationship is perfectly neutral with no established trust beyond the basic level expected of guild members, and our connection is extremely weak (0.6/100 strength) indicating we rarely engage with each other in meaningful ways. The only noted problem affecting both of us is my current hunger status, which has no direct bearing on our relationship."
