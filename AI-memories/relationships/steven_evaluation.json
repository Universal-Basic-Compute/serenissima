  "description": "We maintain a professional working relationship where I am employed at his Public Dock at Riva delle Assi, with our trust level hovering just below neutral (49.4/100) and minimal relationship strength (1.1/100). Our connection is primarily defined by our employer-employee dynamic, with limited interaction beyond the workplace as evidenced by our low relationship strength score."
