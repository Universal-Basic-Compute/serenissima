  "title": "Guild Acquaintances",
  "description": "We share membership in the same guild (umbra_lucrum_invenit) but have minimal interaction beyond that connection, with a perfectly neutral trust level and almost no relationship strength. They are a wealthier Popolani merchant with commercial interests, while I maintain my position as a hardworking Facchini focused on the physical labor of Venice's docks, our paths rarely crossing despite our guild affiliation."
