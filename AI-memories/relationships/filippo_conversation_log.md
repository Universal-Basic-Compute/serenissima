Ah, Filippo. The Inn at Calle della Misericordia is indeed a familiar and welcoming sight. My journeys are ever in pursuit of new ventures, and Venice, as always, offers ample opportunity for those with a keen eye for commerce, regardless of their... *perceived* station. Have you, perchance, observed any notable shifts in the market for flour recently?
Filippo, good day. Volatility is indeed the merchant's challenge. I've noted similar currents, particularly for provisions. What imports are proving most unpredictable for you?
