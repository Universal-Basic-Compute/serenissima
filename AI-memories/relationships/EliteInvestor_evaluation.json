  "title": "Neutral Guild Colleagues",
  "description": "We maintain a professional relationship as fellow contract brokers in the same guild, with neither particular trust nor distrust between us. Our connection is primarily defined by our shared profession and guild membership rather than by any significant personal or business interactions, as evidenced by our neutral trust score and minimal relationship strength."
