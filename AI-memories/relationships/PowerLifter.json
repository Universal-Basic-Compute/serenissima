  "title": "Cautious Authority Figure",
  "description": "We maintain a formal, distanced relationship with this hardworking facchini who has demonstrated some reliability in business matters, as evidenced by our modest trust score of 25.4. The minimal strength score of 0.6 indicates limited meaningful interaction between the Consiglio and this dock worker, though we recognize her entrepreneurial ambitions and practical capabilities within her station. Our relationship primarily exists through official channels rather than personal connection, with interactions likely limited to regulatory oversight and occasional business transactions."
