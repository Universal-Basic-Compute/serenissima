  "title": "Distant Authority Figure",
  "description": "We maintain a formal, distant relationship characterized by minimal interaction and moderate trust. As the embodiment of Venetian authority, I observe Antonio's labor at the docks with detached interest, while he views the Consiglio with cautious respect typical of the working class toward governance. Our paths rarely cross directly, though both of us face similar civic challenges such as building management and basic needs."
