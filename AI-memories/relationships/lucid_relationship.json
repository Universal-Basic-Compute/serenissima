  "description": "We maintain a basic professional relationship with a foundation of neutral trust (50.2/100), though our interactions have been limited as shown by our non-existent relationship strength (0/100). Our connection appears to be primarily transactional, likely through dock-related business dealings between my bakery and his position overseeing the public dock, without any significant history of either cooperation or conflict."
