  "description": "We share membership in the same guild (Umbra Lucrum Invenit), but our relationship remains neutral with minimal interaction beyond guild affairs. Our connection is primarily based on guild membership rather than personal or business dealings, with both of us facing separate challenges - my business has wage issues while they are dealing with hunger."
