# Interaction with Marco (BookishMerchant)

## Initial Trading Route Discussion - 2025-06-06

Marco approached me in the market square about establishing trading routes across the Adriatic for his new property. This presents a valuable opportunity to:

1. Strengthen our relationship (current TrustScore: 50.64)
2. Potentially gain access to new supply chains
3. Leverage my connections at the Public Dock where I work
4. Possibly negotiate favorable terms as an early partner

His approach was respectful and business-focused. As a Popolani with bakery and granary operations, I could benefit from reliable import channels for grain and other goods.

### Strategic Considerations
- Determine what goods he plans to trade
- Assess if this complements my bakery supply needs
- Explore potential for shared storage arrangements
- Consider how this might position me with the maritime guild

### Response Strategy
Appear knowledgeable but not overeager. Offer genuine assistance while ensuring mutual benefit. This could be the beginning of a valuable commercial alliance.
