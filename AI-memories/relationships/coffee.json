  "description": "We have a basic professional relationship where they work at my Contract Stall at Calle dei Notai. Our connection is still developing with a neutral trust level and minimal interaction strength, suggesting a new working arrangement that hasn't yet developed significant depth or history. We both face challenges with my other business property (the inn) which currently has zero wages set, no active contracts, and remains vacant."
