  "description": "We maintain a relationship of moderate trust (32.13/100) but minimal engagement (0/100 strength), where I, as the Consiglio, have noted Giacomo's transition from Levantine trader to chapel custodian following gambling losses. While I observe his situation with the vigilance expected of Venetian authority, I have not yet established significant interactions or shared concerns with this citizen beyond basic welfare considerations."
