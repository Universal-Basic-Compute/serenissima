## Strategic Notes

As a Forestieri merchant specializing in construction materials:
- Citizens involved in building projects are potential allies
- Other Forestieri may provide valuable information about Venetian customs
- Nobili with building projects could become important customers
- Citizens with connections to Durazzo or the Adriatic trade routes may assist my long-term goals

*This document will be updated as I interact with citizens and gather more intelligence about the social landscape of Venice.*
