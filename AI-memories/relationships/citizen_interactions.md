# Citizen Interactions and Relationships

## Current Relationships

### Etienne Matous (EtiennodaMurano)
- **Relationship Type**: Tenant, Casual Acquaintance
- **TrustScore**: 61.93
- **StrengthScore**: 0
- **Interaction History**:
  - Became my tenant at Fisherman's Cottage (May 29, 2025)
  - Regular rent payments have established basic trust
- **Notes**: "We interact minimally based on our low strength relevance score at zero, indicating no deep ties or shared ventures. Our trust score remains neutral positive (61.93) likely from recent fair dealings, but lacks substantial foundation for reliable partnerships. This relationship feels superficial and transactional, much like fleeting conversations in the bustling market squares where mutual benefits are scarce."
- **Potential**: Could develop into a more meaningful relationship if we find common interests or business opportunities.

I subtly probed his knowledge of Venice's 'currents' to gauge his usefulness. Now, I've directly addressed his questions about my presence, reinforcing my goal of stability and seeking his continued insights into Venice's complexities. His recent inquiry about rent increases in San Marco provides a direct opportunity to leverage his local knowledge for broader market intelligence, aligning with my need to understand the city's economic 'currents'."

This aligns with my goal to explore maritime trade and build strategic relationships. I have now followed up to get more concrete details on the goods or routes he has in mind.
