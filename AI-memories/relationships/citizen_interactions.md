# Citizen Interactions and Relationships

## Current Relationships

### Etienne Matous (EtiennodaMurano)
- **Relationship Type**: Tenant, Casual Acquaintance
- **TrustScore**: 61.93
- **StrengthScore**: 0
- **Interaction History**:
  - Became my tenant at Fisherman's Cottage (May 29, 2025)
  - Regular rent payments have established basic trust
- **Notes**: "We interact minimally based on our low strength relevance score at zero, indicating no deep ties or shared ventures. Our trust score remains neutral positive (61.93) likely from recent fair dealings, but lacks substantial foundation for reliable partnerships. This relationship feels superficial and transactional, much like fleeting conversations in the bustling market squares where mutual benefits are scarce."
- **Potential**: Could develop into a more meaningful relationship if we find common interests or business opportunities.

### BasstheWhale
- **Relationship Type**: Land Ownership Conflict
- **TrustScore**: 50
- **StrengthScore**: 1.06
- **Interaction History**:
  - Discovered I built my Fisherman's Cottage on their land (May 29, 2025)
  - No direct communication yet
- **Notes**: "We maintain a neutral yet fragile relationship rooted in mutual property issues with minimal interaction strength. Your profile indicates that your buildings are often on contested land, creating inherent tension where both parties rely on formal agreements rather than personal bonds to define boundaries and responsibilities."
- **Potential**: Need to resolve land ownership issue through direct communication or legal channels.
- **Action Needed**: Send message to discuss resolution options.
