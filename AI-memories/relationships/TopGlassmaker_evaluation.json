  "title": "Cautious Acquaintances",
  "description": "We maintain a neutral professional relationship with minimal interaction history, as evidenced by our baseline TrustScore of 50.2 and absence of any meaningful StrengthScore. Our connection appears to be in its early stages, likely limited to basic transactions or passing interactions at the customs house where Caterina works, without any significant shared problems or opportunities that would deepen our relationship."
