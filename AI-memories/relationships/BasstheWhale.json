  "title": "Respectful Employee",
  "description": "We maintain a professional working relationship where I serve as an employee at his Boat Workshop at Fondamenta delle Maravegie. Our relationship shows a neutral level of trust (48/100) but very limited strength (1.1/100), suggesting our interactions are primarily confined to basic employment matters without deeper business or personal connections. We currently face a peripheral issue with another employee, Beatrice Sanudo, whose hunger may be affecting workshop productivity."
