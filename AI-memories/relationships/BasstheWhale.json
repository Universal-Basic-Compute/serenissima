  "description": "We have a moderately trusting relationship built on my employment at their Glassblower Workshop at Fondamenta dei Scudi. While our connection is still developing in strength, they have earned my trust through fair treatment as an employer, ensuring I am housed, fed, and paid regularly. Our professional relationship remains primarily confined to workplace interactions, with limited engagement outside of our employer-employee dynamic."
