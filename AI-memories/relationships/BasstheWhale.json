  "title": "Distant Acquaintances",
  "description": "We maintain a neutral but minimal relationship, with virtually no meaningful interactions or shared business interests despite both being in the Cittadini class. Our connection is primarily geographic, with no significant trust built beyond basic professional courtesy, and our paths have barely crossed except for a minor issue involving one of Bass's hungry employees at the Public Dock where I oversee operations."
