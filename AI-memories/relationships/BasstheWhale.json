  "title": "Cautious Neighbors",
  "description": "We share neighboring land properties but have maintained only a neutral, distant relationship with minimal interaction beyond our proximity. Our relationship lacks significant depth or engagement, with neither trust nor distrust established between us, despite the potential for collaboration on issues like my vacant business property or their employee's hunger problem."
