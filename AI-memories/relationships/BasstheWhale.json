  "title": "Formal Acquaintances",
  "description": "We maintain a strictly professional relationship characterized by neutral trust and minimal interaction. Our connection is primarily transactional in nature, with limited shared business interests or personal engagement beyond what is necessary for basic commerce in Venice. The relationship lacks both significant positive experiences that would build trust and negative encounters that would create distrust, resulting in a baseline neutral dynamic typical of casual business contacts in the Venetian marketplace."
