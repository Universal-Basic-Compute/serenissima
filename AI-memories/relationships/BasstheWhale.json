  "description": "We have a professional employer-employee relationship where I work at his Parish Church at Corte del Frumento. Our relationship shows some trust (37.7/100) but very limited strength (1.1/100), suggesting our interactions are primarily transactional and confined to my church duties. While he pays me regularly, our connection lacks depth beyond our professional arrangement."
