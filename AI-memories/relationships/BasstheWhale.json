  "description": "We have a professional working relationship where I serve as an employee at their Public Dock at Fondamenta San Sebastiano. While our trust level remains neutral (48.7/100) and our relationship is still developing in strength (1.13/100), the employment connection forms the foundation of our interactions. They provide steady employment, though we have yet to build a deeper connection beyond our professional arrangement."
