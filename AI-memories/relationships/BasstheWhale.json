  "description": "We have a moderately trusting professional relationship where I work at their Printing House, with our connection primarily defined by our employer-employee dynamic. Though our relationship isn't particularly strong in terms of personal connection, they have earned my trust through fair treatment, regular payment, and providing stable employment, making them a reliable employer in my working life as a facchino."
