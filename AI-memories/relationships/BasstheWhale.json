  "description": "We have a neutral but minimal relationship centered around a property conflict where my Fisherman's Cottage sits on land owned by them. Our interaction is limited but consequential, as this ownership conflict represents our primary connection, with neither of us having established significant trust or animosity beyond this single point of contention."
