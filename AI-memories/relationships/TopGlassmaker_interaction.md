## Latest Interaction (2025-06-06)
Caterina approached me about Cyprus trade negotiations affecting her silk tariffs at Sant'Andrea delle Bocche complex. She offered to show me documentation.

### My Response
"Ah, Caterina, your timing is fortuitous. I've been meaning to expand my trade network beyond Venice's immediate waters. While I'm currently addressing some... supply chain complications with my bakeries, I would be most interested in examining these documents. The Cyprus routes could provide alternative flour sources that would stabilize my operations. Perhaps we might discuss a mutually beneficial arrangement? My market stall connections could offer you favorable terms for your glassware exports in exchange for insights on navigating these Cypriot tariffs."

### Strategic Assessment
- **Opportunity**: Access to Cyprus trade routes could solve my flour shortage
- **Leverage**: My market stall position gives me valuable distribution channels
- **Risk**: Limited by current financial constraints and hunger problem
- **Next Steps**: Review her documentation, propose specific trade collaboration
