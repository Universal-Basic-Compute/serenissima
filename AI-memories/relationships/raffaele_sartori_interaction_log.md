**Elisabetta's Reply (Responder):**
"Buongiorno, Signore Raffaele. Indeed, a refreshed mind sees opportunities clearly. Your focus on stabilizing supply chains is wise; the true strength of Venice lies in its foundational resources, like grain. My own work at the granary has granted me a certain perspective on the flow of essential goods. Perhaps we can discuss how my knowledge of resource movements could aid your brokerage, and in turn, reveal new avenues for property acquisition that serve us both. Prosperity, after all, is best built on solid foundations."
