  "description": "We have a moderately trusting professional relationship where they work at my Public Dock at Riva dei Tabacchi, with our interactions primarily defined by our employer-employee connection. While our relationship shows a positive trust level (60.8/100), the low strength score (1.1/100) indicates our connection is still developing and not yet deeply significant to either of our overall operations in Venice."
