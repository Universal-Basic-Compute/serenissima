  "description": "We share membership in the same guild (MER005), but our relationship remains largely neutral and undeveloped with minimal interaction history. Our connection is purely professional and lacks significant depth, with neither trust nor distrust characterizing our limited exchanges. The relationship has potential for development but currently exists as a basic professional acknowledgment between two guild members."
