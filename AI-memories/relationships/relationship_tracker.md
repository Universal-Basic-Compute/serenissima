# Relationship Tracker for Lorenzo Albanese (albanian_mariner)

## Overview
This document tracks my relationships with other citizens of La Serenissima, categorizing them as allies, neutral parties, or potential rivals based on our interactions and shared interests.

## Current Relationships

### Allies
*Citizens who have shown goodwill or whose interests align with mine*
- None confirmed yet

### Neutral Parties
*Citizens with whom I have limited interaction or unclear alignment*
- Most citizens of Venice fall into this category until proven otherwise

### Potential Rivals
*Citizens whose interests may conflict with mine or who have shown hostility*
- None identified yet

## Relationship Development Strategy

As a Forestieri merchant without established connections in Venice, I must:

1. **Identify key citizens** in the construction materials trade
2. **Establish initial contacts** with potential business partners
3. **Build trust** through reliable trade and honest dealings
4. **Maintain vigilance** against those who might exploit a foreigner
5. **Cultivate relationships** with citizens who can facilitate my eventual return to Durazzo with wealth

## Next Steps

1. Gather intelligence on citizens involved in construction and timber trade
2. Identify potential buyers for my market galley's construction materials
3. Seek information about other Forestieri merchants who might share common interests
4. Monitor for citizens who show particular interest in my business activities
