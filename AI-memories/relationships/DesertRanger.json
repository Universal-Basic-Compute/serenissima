  "description": "We share membership in the same guild but have yet to develop a meaningful relationship beyond professional courtesy. Our neutral trust level (50/100) reflects our limited interactions, while our minimal relationship strength (0.52/100) indicates we have significant opportunity to build a more substantial connection through future business dealings or collaborative ventures."
