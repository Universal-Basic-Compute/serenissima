  "title": "Cautious Business Acquaintances",
  "description": "We maintain a neutral professional relationship as fellow merchants in Venice's competitive docks and markets, with minimal interaction beyond necessary business dealings. Our connection is extremely weak (0.6/100 strength), reflecting our limited shared history despite operating in overlapping commercial spheres. While neither trusting nor distrusting each other (50/100 trust), we recognize potential for either cooperation or competition as we both navigate Venice's maritime trade networks from our respective positions in the social hierarchy."
