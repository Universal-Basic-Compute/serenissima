  "title": "Distant Overseer",
  "description": "We maintain a formal, distant relationship characterized by minimal interaction and low mutual engagement, as evidenced by our very low StrengthScore (0.56/100). While there is some minimal trust (25.28/100) slightly above complete distrust, our relationship primarily exists through my role as the authority overseeing various properties including the small warehouse at her location, though this property currently faces issues of vacancy and zero rent that require attention."
