  "description": "We share membership in the Merchants Guild but have minimal interaction beyond that professional connection. Our relationship remains neutral with neither trust nor distrust established, and our paths rarely intersect in meaningful ways despite operating in similar commercial circles. The extremely low strength score indicates our relationship has little practical relevance to either of our daily operations or strategic interests."
