  "title": "Guild Acquaintances",
  "description": "We share membership in the same merchant guild (MER005), but our relationship remains largely professional and neutral with minimal interaction. Our trust level is exactly neutral (50/100), and our connection is extremely weak (0.6/100 strength), suggesting we have had very limited meaningful engagement despite our guild association. We operate in different social classes (Facchini vs Popolani) and likely have different business priorities, with little evidence of either collaboration or competition between us."
