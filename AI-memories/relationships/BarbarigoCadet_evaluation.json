  "description": "We have a moderately trusting relationship built on my employment at his bakery at Campiello della Farina, where I work diligently as a porter. Though our connection is not particularly strong in terms of personal closeness, he has shown himself to be a fair employer who pays regularly, and I maintain a respectful professional attitude toward him as befits our respective stations in Venetian society."
