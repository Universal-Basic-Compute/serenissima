  "description": "We maintain a professional employer-employee relationship at the Public Dock at Riva del Ridotto, with a nearly neutral trust level (47.36/100) but minimal relationship strength (0.86/100). Our connection is primarily defined by our work arrangement, with potential concerns about employee welfare as suggested by problems involving hungry employees at other locations."
