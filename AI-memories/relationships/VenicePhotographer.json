  "title": "Strained Employment",
  "description": "We maintain a professional working relationship at the Contract Stall at Sottoportego dei Marinai, where I am employed by them, but our interactions are marked by significant distrust (-1.63 TrustScore) despite a relatively strong connection (131.25 StrengthScore). They are my employer in a business arrangement that appears functional on the surface but is undermined by underlying tensions, possibly related to recent employee issues including hunger problems affecting their workforce."
