## Potential Relationships to Develop

### Lower-Tier Officials
- **Target**: Identify bureaucrats involved in trade regulation but not high enough to trigger my instinctive mistrust
- **Offering**: Access to accurate nautical charts, potentially exclusive information about Mediterranean conditions
- **Goal**: Facilitate smoother trade operations, advance notice of regulatory changes
- **Approach**: Gradual relationship building through small gestures rather than direct attempts at influence

### Fellow Ionian Traders
- **Purpose**: Create a network of reliable information sources and potential business partners
- **Benefit**: Shared risk, expanded market reach, collective bargaining power
- **Challenges**: Maintaining independence while fostering collaboration
- **Next Steps**: Identify and approach traders with complementary rather than competing interests
