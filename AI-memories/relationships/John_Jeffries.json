  "description": "Our properties in Santa Croce are in close proximity (142 meters), creating a natural geographic connection that could be leveraged for mutual benefit. However, our relationship lacks depth, with no established trust and only moderate strength (131.79), suggesting we are merely aware of each other's presence rather than actively engaged in meaningful commerce or social exchange."
