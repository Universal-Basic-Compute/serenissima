  "description": "We maintain a professional working relationship at the Bakery at Calle della Scuola dei Laneri, where I am employed by them, characterized by basic professional trust but minimal personal connection. Our interaction is primarily transactional and limited to business operations, with neither of us having developed significant rapport beyond our formal roles, as evidenced by our nearly neutral TrustScore and very low StrengthScore."
