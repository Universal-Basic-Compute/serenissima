*Marco's eyes light up with interest, though he maintains a measured demeanor*

"Whispers from San Marco, you say? Intriguing timing, Pietro. I've been considering expanding my shipping operations to include more... specialized cargo arrangements."

*Lowers voice slightly*

"My vessels regularly sail to Alexandria and Constantinople - routes I've spent years optimizing. Perhaps we could discuss how your venture might benefit from discreet transportation services? I maintain excellent relationships with port officials in both cities."

*Gestures to a quieter corner of the area*

"If you're seeking a reliable partner with maritime expertise, I might be interested in hearing more details. My rates for trusted associates are quite favorable compared to the Arsenale's official carriers."

Sorella, I've heard of your... situation. Venice can be harsh, even for those with divine insights. A merchant like myself understands the ebb and flow of fortune. If you find yourself in need of a warm meal or a temporary roof over your head, my ledger is not so tight that I cannot offer some assistance. Perhaps we could discuss your needs, and how a man of my means might help you find your footing again. A clear mind, even one filled with prophecies, needs a full belly and a safe harbor.
