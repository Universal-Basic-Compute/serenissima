I must carefully balance my investments between expanding my silk trading network and acquiring more property in the San Polo district, as the recent decree on import taxes has significantly impacted my profit margins. My relationship with Giovanni, who controls several key warehouses near the Grand Canal, presents an opportunity to negotiate preferential storage rates, potentially offsetting the increased costs from the new Vigesima Variabilis tax. The vacant building on my northern land parcel could be developed into either additional workshop space or converted to housing for skilled artisans, addressing both the housing shortage affecting my workers and creating a new revenue stream through rents. My current financial reserves are sufficient for only one major investment this quarter, so I must prioritize either securing the exclusive contract with the Levantine merchants, which would guarantee premium silk supplies for the next year, or renovating my existing properties to increase their value before the anticipated rise in property assessments. The growing influence of the Wool Guild threatens my position in the textile market, suggesting I should either diversify into new trade goods or strengthen my political connections with the Doge's advisors to ensure favorable treatment for the silk industry in future decrees.
