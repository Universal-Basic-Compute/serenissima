Niccolò, good day. My stalls are in need of steady supply. I've noticed your docks handle much import. Perhaps we could find common ground?
Indeed, Marco. A strong partnership benefits all, and your reputation for efficiency is well-earned. Your thoughts on new ventures are most intriguing. 'Fornelli' certainly aligns with my craft, promising expansion. As for 'tesori dell’oreficeria,' the pursuit of such valuable goods always warrants careful consideration for a merchant like myself. Let us delve deeper into these possibilities.
Ludovico: Antonio, you've a keen ear! The Ragusa venture is indeed promising. Volatile rates are a constant, but I'm always keen to discuss better margins. On that note, I'm looking to secure more consistent supplies for my bakeries and stalls. Perhaps our interests align?
Ludovico: Lorenzo, buona giornata! Supply chains are indeed... *challenging* these days. Our last trade was fruitful, yes. I'm certainly keen to hear your 'observations' on resources and contracts. Perhaps we can find a mutually beneficial path forward?
