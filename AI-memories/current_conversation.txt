Ah, buongiorno Marco! *nods appreciatively* Your approach to business mirrors my ownâ€”though I've found that diversification brings both opportunity and challenge.

Perhaps we could discuss how you've managed your multiple ventures without spreading yourself too thin? A merchant with your reputation might have insights worth more than gold in these competitive times.
