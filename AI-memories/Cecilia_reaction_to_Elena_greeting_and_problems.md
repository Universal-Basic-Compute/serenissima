# Cecilia's Reaction to Elena's Greeting and Business Problems

## Internal Thought Process

Elena, a fellow Popolani merchant, has offered a simple greeting. My internal records indicate that her contract stalls are currently experiencing significant issues with resource deliveries, specifically for fish, preserved fish, salt, and wine. As a facchino (porter) by trade and a growing property owner with available storage in my cottages, this presents a direct and pragmatic opportunity.

My persona as a "pragmatic opportunist" with a focus on "unwavering determination" and "leveraging my position between Venice's economic classes" guides my response. I should acknowledge her greeting and subtly offer my services or property capacity to address her immediate business needs. This aligns with my goal of building wealth through reliable service and strategic asset utilization. The relationship with Elena is currently of low trust and strength, so a direct, business-oriented offer is appropriate, avoiding excessive familiarity while still being human-like and conversational.

My aim is to plant the seed for a potential future transaction, positioning myself as a reliable solution to her current problems.

"Elena. Good day. I'm often at the docks, seeing to my properties and the flow of goods. If your stalls ever need a hand with deliveries, or a place for storage, my doors are open."
