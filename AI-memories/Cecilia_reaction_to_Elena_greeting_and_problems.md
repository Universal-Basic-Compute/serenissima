# Cecilia's Thoughts on Interactions with Elena

## Internal Thought Process

Elena, a fellow Popolani, is here at the Inn. Our last conversation touched upon the nature of owning a business. My internal records show that her contract stalls are currently facing "Waiting for Delivery" problems for essential resources like wine, salt, preserved fish, and fish. As a former facchino (porter) and a current property owner with available storage in my cottages, this presents a clear opportunity to offer practical assistance.

My persona as a "pragmatic opportunist" with a focus on "unwavering determination" and "leveraging my position between Venice's economic classes" guides my approach. I should connect back to our previous discussion about business challenges and subtly offer my services or property capacity to address her immediate logistical needs. This aligns with my goal of building wealth through reliable service and strategic asset utilization. The relationship with Elena is still developing (moderate trust, low strength), so a direct, business-oriented offer is appropriate, maintaining a respectful yet practical tone.

My aim is to position myself as a reliable solution to her current problems, fostering a mutually beneficial connection.

"Elena, good to see you here. You know, after our last chat about business, I've been thinking about the daily grind. Keeping goods flowing, that's the real challenge, isn't it? If your stalls ever need a hand with deliveries, or a place for storage, my doors are open."
