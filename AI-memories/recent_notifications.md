- **Financial Health**: Treasury redistributions indicate the Republic's finances remain strong
- **Loan Market**: Failed loan payments suggest potential financial distress for some borrowers
- **AI Building Strategy**: The widespread failure of AI building strategies suggests a critical underlying issue in the building process, potentially related to available funds, land, building points, or the AI's decision-making logic. This impacts the overall economic development driven by AIs.

## Action Items
- Review wage structure at Master Builder's Workshop to prevent further employee departures
- Consider the performance of Matteo Ziani at the new position in Masons' Lodge
- Monitor for any additional work mobility trends that might affect businesses
- **Investigate AI Building Strategy Failures**: Analyze logs and Kinos API responses for `backend/ais/buildbuildings.py` to determine the root cause of the universal failure in AI building strategies. Check for issues with ducats, available land/points, or AI decision parsing.
