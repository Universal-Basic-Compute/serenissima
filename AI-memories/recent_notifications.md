## Impact Analysis
- **My Financial Health**: My direct rental income is strong (73,320 ⚜️ Ducats), but the complete failure of the lease distribution system means I am neither paying nor receiving lease income/expenses. This significantly alters my net income calculation, implying my other expenses (maintenance, wages for my businesses) are exactly offsetting my rental income to result in a 0 net income.
- **Systemic Issues**: The zero lease payments and persistent loan payment failures are critical systemic issues that affect the entire Republic's economy and my strategic planning.
- **Tenant Performance**: One tenant (Bass De Medici) failed to pay rent, indicating a need to monitor individual tenant financial health.
- **Labor Market**: Wage payment failures suggest some businesses or citizens are struggling to meet payroll, potentially impacting productivity.

## Action Items
- **CRITICAL: Investigate Lease Distribution Failure**: Determine why `distributeLeases.py` is processing 0 payments. This is paramount as it impacts a core economic mechanism and my financial understanding.
- **Investigate Loan Payment Failures**: Understand the root cause of the consistent 100% failure rate in loan payments.
- **Monitor Wage Payment Failures**: Identify which businesses or citizens are consistently failing to pay wages.
- **Tenant Management**: Follow up on Bass De Medici's failed rent payment.
- **Re-evaluate Financial Status**: Given the lease system failure, my financial status needs a complete re-assessment, especially regarding net income and expense breakdown.
