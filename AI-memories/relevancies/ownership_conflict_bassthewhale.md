## Description
I own a **Fisherman's Cottage at Fondamenta dei Castellani Vecchi** on land owned by **BasstheWhale**.

## Notes
Building ID: canal_45.430597_12.353371, Land ID: polygon-1746057352428

## Potential Actions
1. Negotiate a formal lease agreement with BasstheWhale for the land
2. Offer to purchase the land from BasstheWhale
3. Prepare contingency plans if BasstheWhale decides to increase land fees or evict
4. Research legal protections for building owners on others' land
5. Monitor BasstheWhale's activities and relationship with other landowners

## Updates
- **June 1, 2025**: Identified as a medium-priority issue requiring attention. Current tenant (Etienne Matous) is paying rent, so immediate income is not affected, but long-term security is at risk.
