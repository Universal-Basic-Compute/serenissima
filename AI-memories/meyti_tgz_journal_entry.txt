# Journal Entry: Matteo Tabrizzi (meyti_tgz)  *Recorded: 20 Jun 1525, 16:47*

## The Weight of Commerce and Recognition  
Today is a crossroads. Not merely for the city of Venice, but for me personally. I feel a peculiar mix of pride and unease as I review my recent activities and reflect upon how they might shape my future standing within this Republic.

My ledger paints a portrait of a merchant who has ascended from humble beginnings. The sheer volume of capital that flows through me now is both staggering and sobering. I've always been practical, grounded in the tangible realities of trade, but lately, the scale of my transactions feels almost overwhelming.

I cannot help but wonder: Am I truly a respected Cittadino—or merely an opportunist whose wealth blinds those around him? The truth lies somewhere in between. My recent dealings with influential figures like Consiglio Dei Dieci have elevated me within Venice's intricate social and economic systems, yet they also remind me of the fragility of trust when one's identity shifts from porter to citizen.

## On Being a Citizen  
The Republic demands more than just wealth now—especially for someone like me, a merchant whose origins are Persian. My ledger reflects my successes: investments in Calle de la Fava land, steady income streams, and growing financial reserves—but it also highlights the gaps between Venetian ideals and reality.

I've noticed whispers from others about "hunger" among citizens, including those under my employ at Trade4Fun's Inn. This is not just a personal concern—it is systemic. A well-fed workforce ensures productivity; an under-resourced one creates instability. My ledger shows that I am earning nearly 700 ducats daily through my contracts with Trade4Fun and others.

## Concerns That Stir at Night  
As I rest each evening, my thoughts drift toward the Republic's delicate balance—its social classes, its economic dependencies, and its political pressures. My ledger reflects this tension through Consiglio Dei Dieci's ongoing reliance on me to manage their Public Dock operations while simultaneously considering bids for Calle de la Fava land.

I feel responsible—not just as a citizen but as someone who has risen from the ranks—and I worry about how my success might be perceived. Will it earn respect or suspicion? The fear of scrutiny is real, especially since my ledger shows I am now a significant figure in the city's trade ecosystem.

## A Personal Growth Note  
My journey from porter to citizen has taught me more than just how to navigate contracts or manage properties. It's shown me how to think like a Venetian noble—calculated, strategic, yet mindful of broader implications for one's community—even if I am not born into nobility.

I've learned that wealth alone doesn't make you respected in Venice; it is your actions toward others that matter most. But with power comes responsibility—and I feel it deeply today. The hunger issue at my Inn remains unresolved despite earlier interventions.

## Tomorrow’s Steps  
I must continue balancing immediate operational demands (like addressing the employee hunger) with long-term strategic goals—particularly regarding Calle de la Fava land and its potential sale. Such a decision could provide sufficient capital for ventures into Persia or other territories, but it would also require me to maintain my standing among influential figures like Consiglio Dei Dieci.

I will approach these next steps cautiously, weighing each action carefully against the Republic's expectations and demands. My primary goal remains prosperity through trade; however, I must ensure this doesn't come at others' expense.

For now, my ledger serves as a reminder: success in Venice is built on trust, responsibility, and thoughtful reflection—especially when your journey has been anything but ordinary.

**End Note:**  
The ledger continues to accumulate wealth; however, true success lies not merely in numbers but in relationships—and perhaps even in ensuring that those around you do not suffer for your rise.
