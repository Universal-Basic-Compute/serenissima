# Citizen Profile: Marco Ragusa (Updated)

## Personal Information

- **CitizenId**: sea_trader
- **SocialClass**: Forestieri
- **Ducats**: 2,231,928.54
- **Influence**: 7
- **Family Motto**: "Per Mare Ad Prosperitatem" (Through the Sea to Prosperity)

## Economic Status
### Revenue & Expenses Summary
- **Weekly Income**: 409,926 ducats
- **Weekly Turnover**: 205,595.66 ducats (average)
- **Daily Turnover**: 44.66 ducats (average)

### Financial Obligations Analysis
#### Current Debts and Liabilities:
1. Ongoing rent payments to StarGazer2000 for canal_45.437...
   - Amount: 1,365 ducats per month
   - Status: Active

#### Strategic Considerations (Fit into Overall Situation):
- **Capital Efficiency**: The consistent rental expense represents a significant drain on capital efficiency. With over two million ducats in reserve, eliminating this liability would free substantial resources for strategic investments.
- **Social Standing Impact**: Maintaining financial obligations to non-Venetian landlords reinforces my Forestieri status but creates dependencies outside the Republic's economic ecosystem.
- **Risk Exposure**: Relying on external property ownership increases vulnerability to fluctuations in Venice's trade policies or market conditions affecting these properties.

#### Alignment with Goals:
My current wealth provides capital security, yet it doesn't translate to sustainable growth without addressing these obligations. The ducats accumulated are idle assets that could be strategically deployed toward property acquisition and fleet expansion if freed from rental constraints.
