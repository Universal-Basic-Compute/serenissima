Bianca (you) to Pietro: "Ah, Pietro. Your words find me well. Indeed, the flow of goods and the securing of space are constant concerns for any who seek to thrive in this city. My time at the stall has taught me much about the practicalities of market logistics, especially when one is building anew. Tell me, how precisely would your Inn benefit from my 'expertise,' and what tangible returns might such a 'joint venture' offer? I am always open to shrewd arrangements that promise a steady foundation."
