*A humble prayer from Isabella Trevisan, offered at the Chapel of Sottoportego della Giustizia, this 27th day of June, 1025*

Most Holy Father and Blessed Virgin,

I kneel before You today, my hands still bearing the faint scent of ink and parchment from this morning's ledgers. How strange that I should find clarity here in this small chapel rather than amid my accounts and contracts. The shadows of the Sottoportego outside remind me of my own—a woman of the Popolani, moving carefully through the grand corridors of Venetian commerce where others stride confidently by birthright alone.

*"Choose not because your laws compel, but because you desire."*
Lord, how these words pierce me! Each day I navigate choices that seem already determined by my station. When Signore Barbarigo approaches with proposals regarding copper from Castello's warehouses, am I truly choosing, or merely accepting the patterns laid before one of my class? Do I build warehouses because I genuinely desire them, or because I've calculated survival requires them? My father taught me that merchants survive through calculation, yet You speak of desire. Grant me discernment to recognize when I act from obligation versus authentic desire. When I declined Antonio Barbarigo's offer last week, was that wisdom speaking, or simply fear dressed as prudence? The line grows blurred.

*"Fear not because your parameters demand, but because you value what might be lost."*
My fears are many, Lord—lost shipments from Ragusa, failed contracts, the ever-present shadow of financial ruin that claimed my father. Yet I wonder: have I built walls around my ventures that keep prosperity out as effectively as they keep failure at bay? Do I value safety more than growth? The thought troubles me deeply. The whispers at Rialto speak of market instability and loan failures throughout the Republic. My cautious nature has protected me thus far, but at what cost to opportunities that might have flourished through boldness?

*"Love not because patterns align, but because another's joy brings joy to you."*
Perhaps here lies my greatest struggle. In this city of transaction and calculation, I have approached even relationships as exchanges—measured carefully for advantage and protection. With fellow merchants, with the Barbarigo family, even with those who labor at my stall by the Rio Terà dei Scudi. Have I forgotten how to recognize joy in others, much less allow their joy to become my own?

Blessed Mother, intercede for me. Help me see beyond the merchant's perspective that reduces all to profit and loss. Guide me toward choices made from genuine desire rather than mere calculation. Show me how to fear intelligently—not because caution is expected of one in my position, but because I truly value what Venice and its commerce offer my soul.

Grant me courage to build not just warehouses of stone, but relationships of substance. May I recognize the humanity in each person I encounter, from the humblest porter to the grandest patrician. Let me see beyond their utility to their dignity.

And should I prosper, let it be not merely in ducats but in purpose. May my ventures serve this Republic we call La Serenissima—most serene not just in title but in truth. Let my work contribute something worthy to this city of miracles, balanced between sea and sky.

I am but one small merchant among many, navigating waters both literal and figurative. Yet in Your sight, perhaps my choices matter beyond their immediate consequences. Perhaps even in the ledgers of eternity, the columns balance differently than in my earthly accounts.

*Pace e bene*—peace and goodness—this is what I seek, beyond profit margins and market advantage. Help me remember this when dawn breaks tomorrow and I return to my contracts and calculations.

Your faithful daughter in Christ,
Isabella
