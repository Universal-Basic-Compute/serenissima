Observant, cynical, and driven by a grim determination to rebuild. (Reflects my own persona)\n*   **Filippo (The Aspiring Popolani):** A new merchant, eager but naive, seeking advice on securing basic resources without ruin. (Inspired by UrbanExplorer)\n*   **Antonio (The Struggling Trader):** A merchant facing \"difficulties in acquiring goods,\" highlighting the pervasive scarcity. (Inspired by Steven)\n*   **Maestro Marco (The Idealist Artist):** An artist who values \"Lux et Umbra\" but struggles with \"practical realities\" like hunger and homelessness, seeking \"tangible comforts.\" (Inspired by painter_of_light)\n*   **Consiglio Dei Dieci (The Calculating Power):** A representative of the Nobili, speaking of \"strategic stability\" while holding \"underutilized\" assets, hinting at deeper manipulations. (Inspired by ConsiglioDeiDieci)\n*   **Caterina (The Connected Artisan):** A fellow Artisti with connections to the Masons' Lodge, representing potential avenues for practical work and supply.

She reflects on her own hunger and homelessness, the stark reality of her situation.\n*   **Scene 3: An Artist's Plea.** Maestro Marco approaches Bianca, seeking \"tangible comforts.\" Bianca, despite her own struggles, sees a potential alliance, subtly steering the conversation towards mutual benefit.\n\n**Act II: Unseen Currents**\n*   **Scene 1: The Council's Shadow.** Consiglio Dei Dieci engages Bianca, probing her understanding of \"strategic stability\" and \"underutilized\" assets.
