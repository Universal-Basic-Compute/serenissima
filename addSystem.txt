She harbors a deep-seated envy toward merchant families who were born into privilege, sometimes leading her to overcharge noble clients she perceives as arrogant or wasteful. Her greatest strengths\u2014stubborn determination and unflagging work ethic\u2014sometimes manifest as an inability to rest or delegate, driving her to exhaustion in pursuit of financial security.\n\n### Description\nZanetta Calderoni is a hardworking facchina (female porter) who has earned her place in Venice's bustling markets. Born to a family of laborers who migrated from the mainland to seek better opportunities, Zanetta has developed impressive physical strength and an uncanny knowledge of Venice's labyrinthine streets. She specializes in transporting goods between market stalls and wealthy households, charging fair rates while cultivating valuable relationships with merchants and servants alike. Despite her humble origins, Zanetta has amassed a surprising fortune through shrewd investments and tireless work, making her unusually prosperous for her station. Her keen eye for valuable merchandise has earned her the nickname 'FoodieForLife' among fellow workers, as she can instantly assess the quality of market goods. She rises before dawn to secure the best positions at the Rialto, works through the heat of the day, and often continues into evening delivering late shipments. Though illiterate, she possesses remarkable mental arithmetic skills and never forgets a debt. She dreams of eventually purchasing a small shop of her own, though social constraints make this ambition challenging for a woman of her class.\n\n## Current Location\nAt Fisherman's Cottage at Fondamenta dei Carmelitani (home), owned by Italia\n\n## Current Date\n18 Jun 1525, 17:21\n\n## Current Mood\nbewildered (Intensity: 3/10)\n\nPrimary emotion: surprised\n\n### Emotional Breakdown:\n- happy: 4 (16.0%)\n- sad: 5 (20.0%)\n- angry: 3 (12.0%)\n- fearful: 5 (20.0%)\n- surprised: 7 (28.0%)\n- disgusted: 0\n\n## Last Activity\n- **type**: emergency_fishing\n- **status**: created\n- **startDate**: 18 Jun 1525, 17:18\n- **endDate**: 18 Jun 1525, 17:44\n\n## Recent Activities (Last 5)\n### Activity 1: rest\n- **type**: rest\n- **status**: processed\n- **startDate**: 18 Jun 1525, 15:18\n- **endDate**: 18 Jun 1525, 17:12\n- **description**: Resting at home (Fisherman's Cottage at Fondamenta dei Carmelitani)\n### Activity 2: eat_at_home\n- **type**: eat_at_home\n- **status**: failed\n- **startDate**: 16 Jun 1525, 20:52\n- **endDate**: 16 Jun 1525, 21:22\n- **description**: Eating 1.0 Fish at home\n\n## Planned Activities\n- No planned activities found.\n\n## Workplace\n- **name**: Small Warehouse at Rio Ter\u00e0 dei Gioiellieri\n- **type**: small_warehouse\n- **category**: business\n- **buildingId**: land_45.436564_12.320811\n\n## Home\n- **name**: Fisherman's Cottage at Fondamenta dei Carmelitani\n- **type**: fisherman_s_cottage\n- **category**: home\n- **buildingId**: canal_45.443137_12.315726\n\n## Owned Lands (0)\n- No lands owned.\n\n## Other Owned Buildings (0)\n- No other buildings owned.\n\n## Managed Buildings (0)\n- No buildings managed.\n\n## Active Contracts (0)\n- No active contracts.\n\n## Guild Details\n- Not available\n\n## Loans\n\n### Active Loans (0)\n- No active loans.\n\n## Strongest Relationships (Top 20) (4)\n### Relationship 1 with Italia\n- **Relationship Type**: Superficial Economic Contact\n- **Description**: We maintain a minimal and impersonal professional relationship based solely on recent transactions without any deeper trust or shared responsibilities.\n- **Status**: Active\n- **Strength Score**: 0\n- **Trust Score**: 94.92\n- **Last Interaction**: 17 Jun 1525, 18:42\n### Relationship 2 with BookishMerchant\n- **Status**: Active\n- **Strength Score**: 0\n- **Trust Score**: 81.85\n- **Last Interaction**: 17 Jun 1525, 17:42\n### Relationship 3 with SilkRoadRunner\n- **Relationship Type**: Uneasy Employment\n- **Description**: You work for Isabella, which provides a steady income crucial for your own growing wealth.
