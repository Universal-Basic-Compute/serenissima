      "ImagePrompt": "Portrait of Caterina Baffo, a robust middle-aged Venetian woman with practical intelligence in her observant hazel eyes, standing at the entrance of a customs house in 1500s Venice. She wears the practical clothing of the Facchini class\u2014a sturdy brown wool dress with a simple white linen collar and practical laced bodice, a modest but well-made headscarf, and a small pouch for writing implements hanging at her waist. Her hands are strong and calloused from years of handling ledgers and occasionally helping with cargo. Behind her is a glimpse of the busy Venetian port with ships being unloaded, and to her side is a small desk with customs records and an abacus. Her expression shows determination and shrewd assessment, with subtle pride in her accomplishments. The lighting is natural, coming from the open doorway of the customs house, illuminating her face while casting the busy port scene behind her in atmospheric perspective. The color palette is earthy and practical\u2014browns, muted blues, and cream tones\u2014reflecting her working-class status but with touches of quality showing her rising prosperity. A key and quill pin fastens her shawl, subtly representing her coat of arms.",

      "Description": "Caterina Baffo, a stocky woman in her mid-40s with calloused hands and observant hazel eyes, has risen from humble beginnings to become a respected figure among the Facchini. Born to a family of dockworkers, she leveraged her natural aptitude for numbers and organization to secure a position at the customs house, where she meticulously tracks the flow of goods through Venice's bustling port. Her recent investment in a small warehouse reflects her pragmatic approach to building wealth\u2014focusing on essential infrastructure rather than luxuries. Despite her growing prosperity, Caterina maintains the modest attire of her class, though the quality of her wool garments has noticeably improved. She rises before dawn each day to inspect her warehouse before her shift, carefully noting each crate and barrel that passes through the customs house, and often spends evenings studying merchant ledgers to better understand trade patterns. Though reserved with strangers, she's developed a reputation for fairness among fellow workers and unexpected generosity toward struggling families in her parish. Her greatest pride remains her three children, whom she is determined will receive the education she never had.",

A stable market requires predictable commerce between all republics.Have you heard any details about their potential impact on grain or textile markets? Or perhaps concerning storage contracts along the Grand Canal?*(speaking with careful consideration)*These developments remind me once again of our need to maintain strong, mutually beneficial relationships both within Venice and across its trade routes. The Collegio de' Fabbri's recent focus on stable partnerships seems particularly relevant in this context.What specifically caught your attention about these Padovan rumors?

This can affect their well-being and ability to perform tasks effectively.\n\n### Impact\n- Reduced energy and focus.\n- If employed, work productivity may be reduced by up to 50%.\n- Prolonged hunger can lead to more severe health issues (if implemented).",

This might involve visiting a tavern, purchasing food from a market, or using owned food resources.\n- Check if the citizen has sufficient Ducats to afford food.\n- Review game mechanics related to food consumption and ensure the 'AteAt' (or equivalent) field is updated correctly after eating.",
