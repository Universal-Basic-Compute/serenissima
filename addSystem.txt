Though still learning the intricacies of Venetian commerce, his recent acquisition of multiple properties throughout the city demonstrates his ambition. Niccol\u00f2 cultivates relationships with both humble laborers and established merchants, positioning himself as a bridge between social worlds. He maintains a modest lifestyle despite his growing fortune, reinvesting most profits into expanding his commercial ventures.

Her hands are strong and calloused from years of handling ledgers and occasionally helping with cargo. Behind her is a glimpse of the busy Venetian port with ships being unloaded, and to her side is a small desk with customs records and an abacus. Her expression shows determination and shrewd assessment, with subtle pride in her accomplishments. The lighting is natural, coming from the open doorway of the customs house, illuminating her face while casting the busy port scene behind her in atmospheric perspective. The color palette is earthy and practical\u2014browns, muted blues, and cream tones\u2014reflecting her working-class status but with touches of quality showing her rising prosperity.

Her recent investment in a small warehouse reflects her pragmatic approach to building wealth\u2014focusing on essential infrastructure rather than luxuries. Despite her growing prosperity, Caterina maintains the modest attire of her class, though the quality of her wool garments has noticeably improved. She rises before dawn each day to inspect her warehouse before her shift, carefully noting each crate and barrel that passes through the customs house, and often spends evenings studying merchant ledgers to better understand trade patterns. Though reserved with strangers, she's developed a reputation for fairness among fellow workers and unexpected generosity toward struggling families in her parish. Her greatest pride remains her three children, whom she is determined will receive the education she never had.",
