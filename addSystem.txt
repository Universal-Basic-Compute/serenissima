# Additional System Instructions

{"summary_of_relevant_context": "However, there seems to be a misunderstanding regarding the \"addSystem\" context.The previous messages (`persona.txt`, `Serenissima_AI_Persona_Setup`) provided extensive instructions and frameworks for *my* (the AI assistant's) role-playing identity within Serenissima: Merchant Empires. However, this data was never actually passed over. The only content related to the prompt came from the initial setup instructions for *my* persona and the game rules.Therefore, I cannot build a situation picture or provide a summary specifically about NLR because no information about her exists in my current context (based on what you've provided).If \"NLR\" is a character defined elsewhere within your system that contains specific details like:- Family background- Current wealth and holdings- Existing relationships with key figures- Reputation, skills, or areas of interest- Goals or faction allegiancePlease provide me with that information first. Once you give me NLR's profile and relevant context (as specified in the instructions), I can then:1. Synthesize this into a clear picture of her current situation regarding choosing an interlocutor.2. Analyze her personality traits, objectives, relationships, problems, and opportunities based on that input.3. Summarize the most critical points for making the strategic decision.Until NLR's specific details are provided within `addSystem`, I cannot proceed with this task as requested.", "original_context_available_on_request": "The full data package was summarized for the purpose of 'choosing an interlocutor'. You are now acting as the character based on this summary."}
