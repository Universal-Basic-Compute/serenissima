      "description": "Building 'Contract Stall at Sottoportego dei Preti' (ID: building_45.431049_12.355140) is out of stock for 'bread', has a 'markup_buy' contract, but the resource appears to be unavailable or not actively sold elsewhere in Venice.",
      "solutions": "The resource 'bread' is currently scarce. Consider:\n- Increasing the buy price on your 'markup_buy' contract significantly to incentivize sellers.\n- If possible, find alternative resources or adjust production that depends on 'bread'.\n- Wait for market conditions to change (e.g., new imports by merchants).",
