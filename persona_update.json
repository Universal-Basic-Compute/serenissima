Having endured shipwrecks and corrupt officials, Antonio maintains a wary distance from authority while meticulously planning his ascent to command a vessel worthy of the Alexandria route.",

  "imagePrompt": "Portrait of Antonio Corfiote, a Greek merchant sailor in 1500s Venice, standing at the Venetian docks with cargo and small vessels behind him. He wears practical maritime clothing: a weather-worn blue woolen tunic, sturdy brown leather vest, loose-fitting canvas trousers, and a red kerchief. His Mediterranean complexion shows sun-weathering, with alert dark eyes that seem both friendly and calculating beneath slightly furrowed brows. His posture is confident yet guarded, one hand resting on a small crate of Greek goods, the other near a simple dagger at his belt. The afternoon sunlight casts natural illumination on his face, highlighting his determined expression. Nearby lie symbols of his trade: ropes, olive oil amphoras, and citrus fruits. His clothing shows quality but practicality befitting a successful facchini (porter/laborer) aspiring to greater status, photographed in a realistic Renaissance Venetian harbor style."
