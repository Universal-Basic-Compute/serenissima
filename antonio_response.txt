Isabella, your observations on the market's currents are keen. Indeed, securing both skilled hands and quality materials is a constant challenge for any artisan, especially for an operation like your Luxury Showroom. As the operator of your Goldsmith Workshop, I am acutely aware of these pressures. Perhaps a more direct arrangement for the workshop's output, or even its raw material supply, could offer the synergistic solution you seek? A stable flow benefits us both.
