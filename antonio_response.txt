Salve, Elisabetta. Your keen eye for the market is, as ever, precise. Indeed, the matter of the jewelry from the Goldsmith Workshop has been... under consideration. Your intelligence regarding the current prices is noted, and it aligns with my own observations of Venice's appetite for such finery. Perhaps your insights into optimizing these sales contracts could prove mutually beneficial. I am always open to discussions that promise to maximize the flow of ducats through our Republic's veins.
