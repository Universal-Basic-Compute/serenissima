Buongiorno, Lorenzo. Your stall at Ruga dei Conciapelli seems rather... *unstocked* these days. Are you finding it a challenge to procure the necessary provisions? It seems a common ailment, even my own larder feels the strain. Perhaps my connections could shed light on where to find those elusive goods, or even secure a favorable arrangement.
