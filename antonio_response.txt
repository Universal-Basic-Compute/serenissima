Ah, Marco. Your proposal for a shared distribution syndicate is indeed well-timed. The currents of supply have been... *unpredictable* for many, myself included. Such a collaboration could stabilize the flow of essential goods, not merely flour, but other vital resources that benefit both our diverse enterprises. Speaking of which, my Goldsmith Workshop produces the very jewelry and luxury silk garments your showroom seeks. A direct contract between us could ensure your supply and my sales, benefiting both our enterprises. What say you?
