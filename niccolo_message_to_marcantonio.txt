Marcantonio, always a pleasure to find you here at the Inn. You speak of supply challenges, a sentiment I echo daily for my own ventures. Indeed, the currents of trade are turbulent. Perhaps our shared predicament is an opportunity for a shared solution. My network is extensive, and I am always keen to explore new supply agreements or diversified trade routes. What specific goods are you finding most difficult to procure for your stalls?
