## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing the decision engine:

1. **Maintain Decision Records**
   - Document major decisions and their rationale
   - Track outcomes and compare to expectations
   - Analyze patterns of successful and unsuccessful choices
   - Use historical decisions to inform future approaches

11. **Incorporate Resource Selling Decisions**
    - Analyze which buildings can sell which resources
    - Consider current resource stockpiles and production capacity  
    - Evaluate import prices and typical contract rates for each resource
    - Establish public sell contracts at competitive rates
    - Focus on resources that can be produced without input materials
    - Start with limited contracts while securing supply chains
    
    - Current Decision:
      Given no existing resource stockpiles, I will create two initial contracts
      to establish revenue streams with resources I can currently produce:
      
      1. Banking services from customs house (building_45.440840_12.327785)
         - Resource: banking_services
         - Hourly Amount: 2  
         - Price per Resource: 75 ducats (1.25x 60 ducat import price)
         - Reasoning: Can generate banking services without inputs. Limited amount
           to start, with competitive pricing for this premium service.
           
      2. Spiced wine from merchant's house (building_45.431950_12.351984)  
         - Resource: spiced_wine
         - Hourly Amount: 1
         - Price per Resource: 90 ducats (1.25x 72 ducat import price)
         - Reasoning: Can process spiced wine from imported regular wine.
           Very limited initial quantity until wine imports stabilize.
           Pricing slightly above import cost for this premium good.
           
      These contracts allow me to start generating revenue with resources
      I can currently supply, without overcommitting. As I build up my
      input stockpiles, I can expand contracts for other processed goods.

12. **Incorporate Resource Import Decisions**
    - Analyze which buildings can import which resources
    - Consider the import prices of different resources
    - Prioritize resources needed for production or that have high value
    - Balance hourly import amounts based on financial capacity
    - Create a specific, actionable import plan
    
    - Current Decision:
      Starting with no existing import contracts, I will establish a
      set of strategic imports to enable production and build inventory:
      
      ```json
      {
        "import_decisions": [
          {
            "building_id": "building_45.440840_12.327785",
            "resource_type": "flour",
            "hourly_amount": 5,
            "reason": "Essential input for bread production at bakeries, low cost (14 ducats) with high revenue potential"
          },
          {
            "building_id": "building_45.440840_12.327785",
            "resource_type": "wine",
            "hourly_amount": 4,
            "reason": "Base material for spiced wine production, low cost (10 ducats) enabling 93 ducats/unit sales" 
          },
          {
            "building_id": "building_45.440840_12.327785",
            "resource_type": "paper",
            "hourly_amount": 3,
            "reason": "Essential input for maps production, supports high-value 250 ducats/unit map sales"
          },
          {
            "building_id": "building_45.440840_12.327785",
            "resource_type": "banking_services",
            "hourly_amount": 3,
            "reason": "Direct resale opportunity at 77 ducats vs 60 ducats import cost, immediate 28% profit margin"
          },
          {
            "building_id": "building_45.440840_12.327785",
            "resource_type": "raw_silk",
            "hourly_amount": 2,
            "reason": "High-value luxury material (180 ducats) for future silk fabric production and portfolio diversification"
          }
        ]
      }
      ```
      
      This import strategy focuses on key inputs for my bakeries (flour), spiced wine production (wine), 
      and maps (paper), while also bringing in banking services for direct resale and raw silk as a 
      high-value material for future production. The quantities are balanced against my current treasury
      while enabling revenue generation across multiple product lines.
