Buongiorno, Lorenzo. Rumors are like the tides in Venice, always flowing. What is it that has caught your ear? I trust it's not more ill tidings regarding the grain supply, or perhaps something that affects our workshops? Speaking of which, my Bakery at Rio Ter√† dei Magazzini remains vacant, a situation I am keen to resolve. Perhaps this rumor touches upon opportunities that could bring it back to life, or assist with your own ventures?
