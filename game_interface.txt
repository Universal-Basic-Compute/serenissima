  "selected_point_index": 10,
  "reason": "I'm selecting building point 10 (near Fondamenta dell'Arsenale) because it provides ideal positioning for a warehouse. This location offers proximity to the waterfront for easy goods transport, connects well to the multiple market stalls already on this land, and is strategically positioned near the Arsenale - Venice's industrial hub. The street name 'Fondamenta dell'Arsenale' suggests this was historically used for maritime commerce, making it perfect for my warehouse operations. This location balances accessibility for merchants while maintaining appropriate distance from residential and bakery facilities."
