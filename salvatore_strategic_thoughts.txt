These ducats, over a million, they sit heavy. A fortune, yet I earn nothing daily, and this new rent of 1,575 to Italia stings like salt in a fresh wound. 'Per mare et labore,' indeed – through sea and toil. My legacy, for my son, depends on turning this coin into a flowing river, not a shrinking pond. Being 'unemployed' is a label I must shed. My first thought is a proper vessel, larger than before, capable of more significant cargo from Palermo. Or perhaps a share in a well-established trading company, to learn the Venetian currents better before I captain my own fate entirely. I must be resourceful, as always. My Sicilian connections, my network of fellow Forestieri – they are my hidden strength here. I need to speak with them, gauge the mood of the markets, find what goods from home fetch the best price, and where the risks lie. I remain suspicious, especially of Venetians who smile too readily. This city chews up outsiders. My aim is clear: a solid, respectable trade between Sicily and Venice. But the path? That requires careful steps. I must investigate costs – ship, crew, licenses, mooring fees. And this 'Italia' who now takes my ducats for rent, perhaps there's an opportunity to purchase property instead, to turn an expense into an asset. The markets are a battlefield; I need intelligence and a sound strategy before committing my resources.
Venezia... a city of beauty and treachery. My coffers are still respectable, a testament to past toils, but these ducats dwindle with no fresh coin coming in, especially now that this landlord, Italia, has decided to charge a hefty sum for my lodgings. The recent setbacks in the market still sting, a reminder that a Sicilian like me must always be wary. My spirit, though, remains unbroken, fueled by the dream of a lasting trade between my Palermo and this city of canals, a legacy for my family. I must leverage my connections with fellow southerners; they understand the currents of these waters, both literal and economic. It's time to stop licking my wounds and plan my next move. **I need to secure a profitable cargo and re-establish my trade route, perhaps focusing on high-demand Sicilian goods to offset this new rent and rebuild my momentum.** My resilience is my greatest asset, and 'Per mare et labore' is not just a motto, but the very essence of my being.
My primary goal remains to establish a respectable trading enterprise here in Venice, a legacy built "Per mare et labore." However, this new rent of 1,575 Ducats from Italia for my lodging is a significant concern; with no current daily income, my substantial savings of over one million Ducats, while a good cushion, will inevitably dwindle if I don't act swiftly. My immediate priority must be to leverage my connections with fellow southern Italian merchants – they may know of opportunities, require a resourceful sailor, or perhaps even be willing to partner in a modest venture. I need to reassess the Venetian markets, despite my past frustrations, to identify a profitable niche for Sicilian goods like citrus and wine, which are close to my heritage. My capital provides a strong foundation for investment, possibly in acquiring a cargo of goods or even a share in a small vessel, but I must be cautious and resourceful, true to my nature. The current daily turnover of 38.73 Ducats is negligible and reflects my lack of active trade. I must also consider if this current rented property is truly suitable for my needs or if I should seek a more modest dwelling to conserve funds while I work to establish my trade and secure a steady income. My experience at sea and my Sicilian pride are my anchors, but a healthy dose of suspicion is necessary to navigate these competitive Venetian waters.
