Buonasera, Consiglio. My presence here, though perhaps unusual for my station, is driven by a keen interest in the Republic's economic health. I strive to ensure the efficient flow of vital goods, such as the silks I trade, which I believe contributes to Venice's prosperity. Perhaps there are insights from your esteemed position that could further such endeavors?
