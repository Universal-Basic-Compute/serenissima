Marco, your words resonate. 'Essential resources' are indeed the lifeblood of any enterprise, and I've observed some... *bottlenecks*... in the flow of goods, particularly at the docks. My own operations, including my Bakery and the public docks I oversee, could perhaps offer a more reliable conduit for your needs. What say you to a discussion on how we might streamline these vital supply lines for mutual gain?
