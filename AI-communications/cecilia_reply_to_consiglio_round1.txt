Grazie, Eminentissimo Consiglio. I am pleased my efforts resonate with your strategic vision for Venice. Indeed, ensuring stable and appropriate lodgings for our citizens, particularly those of the Popolani and Facchini classes, is a civic conduit I strive to maintain. This focus on citizen well-being, I believe, directly contributes to the Republic's overall stability and prosperity, aligning with our shared priorities.
