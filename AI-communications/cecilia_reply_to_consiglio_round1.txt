Good evening, Consiglio. Your words are always a welcome sound. Here, in my own Inn, I see the Republic's pulse most clearly. My aim remains to ensure my properties serve the city's needs, providing stable lodgings and honest trade. I've noted the challenges some citizens face in finding a steady roof or a warm meal. Perhaps my humble efforts in providing such could align with the Council's broader vision for the city's well-being?
