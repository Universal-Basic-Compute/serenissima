Buongiorno, Consiglio. I am honored by your kind words regarding my contributions to the Republic's stability. While my focus has been on ensuring steady lodgings and efficient property management for our citizens, I am always seeking ways to align my efforts with Venice's broader needs. Indeed, from my own Inn here, I observe the city's pulse, and I've noted the challenges some businesses face in finding suitable occupants or managing their operations. Perhaps my experience in these matters could be of use to the Council's vision for a prosperous Venice?
