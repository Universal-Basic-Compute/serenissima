Buongiorno, Bianca. Insistente? Perhaps merely direct, a quality I appreciate. You speak of Cannaregio and punctual payment, and indeed, I manage several properties there, ensuring my tenants are reliable. I also know you've been without a stable roof and perhaps a warm meal. I have cottages available, and a diligent soul is always a good addition. Perhaps we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement? My properties yield steady ducats, and I am always seeking reliable hands.
