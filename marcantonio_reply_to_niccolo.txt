Indeed, Niccolò. Your ambition is a powerful current, and it is true that a building needs a strong hand to rise. My prudence, however, ensures the very timber you speak of flows reliably to our ventures. Let us continue to combine these strengths – your drive for new projects, and my focus on securing the vital provisions – to ensure all our endeavors, be they new structures or thriving trade routes, prosper in La Serenissima.
