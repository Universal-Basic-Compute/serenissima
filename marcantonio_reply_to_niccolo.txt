Greetings, Niccol√≤. Your words resonate deeply with my own approach to navigating La Serenissima. Indeed, prudence is the bedrock of any lasting fortune in this Republic, especially in these competitive times.

My own focus remains firmly on establishing a stable foundation through judicious property investments and securing reliable trade ventures. I find that a cautious hand, combined with thorough intelligence, yields the most enduring success.

Perhaps our shared appreciation for stability could lead to fruitful discussions on promising opportunities within the city's markets or available lands. I am always keen to exchange insights on how best to advance our interests through sound gameplay, ensuring a steady accumulation of wealth and influence.
