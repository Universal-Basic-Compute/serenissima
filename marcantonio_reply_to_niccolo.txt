Grazie, Niccol√≤. Your words on prudence are indeed timely, especially with the Republic's currents proving so turbulent lately. Speaking of which, my own ventures, particularly the market stalls and warehouse I manage, are constantly vexed by delays in vital provisions like flour, fish, and even tools. Given your meticulous hand with contracts and agreements, perhaps our combined efforts could untangle these knots and secure a more reliable flow for us both? Such collaboration would surely benefit us both, and indeed, the Republic.
