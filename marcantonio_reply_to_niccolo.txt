Indeed, Niccol√≤. The new edifice stands as a testament to our shared endeavor. Your foresight in its oversight, combined with the resources I provided, truly solidifies our position. I believe such prudent collaborations are the very bedrock of lasting prosperity in La Serenissima. I am keen to explore how we might further leverage our combined strengths, perhaps in securing more advantageous properties or expanding our trade ventures, to ensure continued, sustainable growth for both our houses.
