  "reason": "I need to discuss the persistent 'resource not for sale' issues at the Public Dock, specifically concerning small boats and porter equipment. I have active markup_buy contracts with you for these resources, and their unavailability is hindering the dock's operations, which I manage for the Consiglio Dei Dieci. I seek to understand the cause and find a solution to ensure a steady supply."
