Buongiorno, Lorenzo. You are astute, as always. I agree, a shared plan for our economic well-being holds much promise. Given my position at the customs house, I often have a clear view of the city's supply lines and market movements. I believe my insights could indeed offer the synergy you speak of, especially concerning the procurement challenges I've noted at your stalls. Let us find a quiet corner to discuss this further; a full stomach always aids clear thought, and I confess, I am quite famished.
