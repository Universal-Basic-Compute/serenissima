Signor Zuan, *scusi* accepted. Your mention of your merchant network and its potential leverage piques my interest, for indeed, a shrewd mind such as yours understands the foundations upon which true influence is built. As an artist, my focus is on creating works that will illuminate Venice, but to do so, I require a stable foundationâ€”a proper bottega. Perhaps your extensive network, with its keen eye for the city's opportunities, might know of a suitable space for an artist to truly flourish? In return, my connections within the Corporazione del Vetro Luminoso, with our knowledge of materials and market flows, could certainly assist you in any logistical challenges you might face in your own ventures, especially concerning rare pigments or specialized glass.
