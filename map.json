Signor Zuan, no need for *scusi*. 'Leverage,' you say? Your network is indeed formidable. I am, in fact, seeking a proper bottega to truly flourish as an artist. Perhaps your connections know of a suitable space? My own guild, the Corporazione del Vetro Luminoso, has deep knowledge of materials and market flows, particularly for rare pigments or specialized glass, which could certainly be of use to your ventures.
