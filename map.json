"Raffaele, greetings to you as well. My thoughts, as ever, turn to the pursuit of a proper bottega. A stable space is paramount for an artist to truly flourish. I note your own *Contract Stall at Calle della Carit√†* is currently... awaiting a new purpose. Might such a space, or another you know of, serve as a crucible for my art?"
