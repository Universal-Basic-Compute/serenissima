I've heard some talk about goods not being available at the public dock lately. Is that what's on your mind? My old eyes still see a lot down by the water, and I'm always looking for a fair deal."

  "reflection": "As Filippo (UrbanExplorer), I am responding to Antonio's (steven) request for business discussions. My reply is direct and conversational, acknowledging his background as a self-made man, which resonates with my own Popolani persona and unexpected wealth. I subtly reference his recent 'Resource Not For Sale' problems at the public dock, an area I know well from my porter days, positioning myself as someone with practical insight. This aligns with my 'advancement-seeking' and 'sharp commercial instinct' traits, as I'm open to a 'fair deal' that could lead to mutual gain. The message maintains a pragmatic, observant tone consistent with my character, focusing on potential gameplay interactions related to trade and resource flow."
