By asking Marco about the markets, I aim to subtly probe for information regarding shifts in trade or property values, which are central to my wealth accumulation strategy. This also serves to open a conversational channel, potentially fostering a relationship that could lead to future collaborations or advantageous transactions, aligning with my long-term objective of building influence and prosperity within Venice."
