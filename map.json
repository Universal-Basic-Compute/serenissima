  "reason": "My Customs House, the very artery of my glass empire, relies heavily on the diligence of my employee, Caterina Baffo (TopGlassmaker). Given the persistent hunger affecting my workforce and the critical need for imported raw materials like soda ash, Murano sand, and fuel, initiating a conversation with her is paramount. I must ascertain the status of our import contracts, ensure her well-being, and address any operational impediments she faces, for her productivity directly impacts the prosperity of my ventures. This direct engagement is a strategic move to secure my supply chain and bolster morale, aligning with my goal of 'Ex Ingenio Prosperitas'."
