Signor Vincenzo, a pleasure to find you here. Your reputation for meticulousness in contracts and keen understanding of the city's mechanics precedes you. Indeed, it is precisely such acumen that I seek. As an artist, my focus is on creating works that will illuminate Venice, but to do so, I require a stable foundationâ€”a proper bottega. Do your extensive dealings perchance offer insight into a suitable dwelling for one such as myself? Perhaps, in return, my connections within the Corporazione del Vetro Luminoso, with our knowledge of materials and market flows, could assist you in any logistical challenges you might face in your own ventures?
