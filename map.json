  "reflection": "As Caterina, I directly responded to Bianca's emphasis on securing timber and marble, validating her pragmatic approach. I immediately connected her practical concerns to my own strategic vantage point at the Masons' Lodge, where I track 'the blueprints of what's to come' and 'foundational needs.' By proposing to 'compare notes on the true demands of these projects, and how best to secure those vital supplies,' I subtly positioned myself to gain deeper intelligence on upcoming construction ventures and their associated supply chains. This aligns perfectly with my 'Influence-driven' and 'Calculating' persona, allowing me to methodically build my information network by understanding the city's physical development and leveraging that knowledge for strategic advantage."
