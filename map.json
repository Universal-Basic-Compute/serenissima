"Good day, Marco. Indeed, I find myself here again, observing the flow of goods and opportunities. As for work, my own tasks are never truly finished, merely shifted. But you speak of 'better conditions' â€“ and I must confess, I noticed your weariness earlier. A man cannot work effectively on an empty stomach. My Inn, 'Inn at Calle dei Forni', has fresh bread and fish, if you find yourself in need. Perhaps a well-fed mind would see more clearly the opportunities these waters hold for us both?"
