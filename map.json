"Buongiorno, Antonio. A pleasure to find you here. My 'workshops,' as you call them, are more akin to my humble stall at Corte Morosini, and thankfully, the coastal disruptions haven't directly touched my pigments or canvases there. However, your mention of such matters brings to mind my own pressing need: a proper bottega, a stable dwelling. As an artist, a secure space would greatly enhance my capacity to create and, by extension, contribute to Venice's prosperity. Given your acumen in property, do you perchance know of any suitable spaces that might suit an artist in need of a roof?"
