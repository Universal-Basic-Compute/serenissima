  "selected_point_index": 3,
  "reason": "I have selected the point corresponding to the historical 'Fondaco dei Greci' (Greek Merchants' Warehouse). This location is intrinsically aligned with the purpose of a Small Warehouse, offering historical precedent as a center for trade and storage. Its strategic positioning, likely with excellent canal access and within a historically significant commercial area, will provide maximum visibility and potential for income, directly supporting my persona's focus on trade and rapid expansion."
