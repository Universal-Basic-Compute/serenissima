  "reason": "To establish a foundational commercial enterprise, specifically a warehouse, which aligns with my persona's focus on strategic warehouse operations and provides a base for future trade and production. This land, 'Campo de Santa Elena' in Castello, offers a significant number of building points (35) with no existing structures, providing ample room for future expansion and directly addressing my 'workless' status by putting my ducats to productive use."
