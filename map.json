As you well know, a thriving Republic benefits from every ducat earned and every property optimized. I also note the recent adjustments to my wages at the Public Dock and the rent for my dwelling; such prudent management ensures stability for all citizens. My work in contracts and property management often brings me across opportunities to activate dormant assets, ensuring they contribute fully to Venice's prosperity. Perhaps there are ways our interests might align in ensuring all corners of La Serenissima are productive. I am always open to discussing how my expertise might serve the greater good, and indeed, our mutual prosperity.",
