  "reason": "As a Popolani citizen focused on textile production, and having recently invested in an industrial workshop, securing a stable and cost-effective supply of raw wool is paramount. The economic outlook indicates high demand for wool fabrics, making it strategically beneficial to initiate a conversation with the Arte dei Lanaioli to negotiate a long-term supply contract or explore bulk purchasing options. This directly supports the profitability and expansion of my textile business."
