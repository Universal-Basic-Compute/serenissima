More importantly, I offered my expertise in properties, aligning with my strategic goal of leveraging my network and assets to foster new relationships and potential business ventures, such as securing a new tenant or a collaborative artistic enterprise. This move aims to advance my influence and wealth within the Republic by turning a casual encounter into a strategic opening."
