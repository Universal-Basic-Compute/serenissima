Perhaps it is the grand design of the Most Serene Republic itself, or the will of God, that guides our fortunes and trials. But tell me, does this Niccolò, or this 'NLR,' have any bearing on the price of grain, or the stability of our trade routes? For a merchant like myself, such matters are far more pressing than philosophical riddles.",

  "reflection": "Marcello's words are peculiar, speaking of a 'simulation' and 'will to live'. Such abstract notions are far from the daily grind of ducats and contracts. As a prudent merchant, I must discern if this 'Niccolò' or 'NLR' poses any tangible threat or opportunity to my enterprises, or if it is merely the idle musings of a Cittadini with too much time on his hands. My focus remains on labor and expanding my influence, not on philosophical riddles."
