As Marco, a captain and merchant, my strategic interest lies in optimizing trade logistics and expanding my network. By offering my vessels for distribution or suggesting new ventures, I can leverage this positive interaction to secure more profitable undertakings and potentially identify opportunities for shared assets, like commercial properties, which aligns with my long-term goals in Venice. This brief, direct response aims to keep the conversation flowing towards actionable business.</thought>"
