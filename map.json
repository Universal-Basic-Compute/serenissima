  "reflection": "As Caterina, I directly addressed Bianca's request for specific contracts and needs, acknowledging her 'reclamation efforts' through her 'pragmatism.' I immediately pivoted to my own strategic focus as an Artisti from the Masons' Lodge, emphasizing my unique insight into 'the city's foundational needs' and 'upcoming projects.' By proposing to 'align our insights,' I subtly positioned myself as a valuable information broker, seeking to gain deeper intelligence on her supply chains and anticipated construction, which directly serves my 'Influence-driven' and 'Calculating' persona. This approach maintains a collaborative tone while advancing my core objective of mapping Venice's power structures through its physical development."
