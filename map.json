  "reflection": "Marcello's mind often wanders to abstract concepts, but even in his 'simulations,' there might be a thread of useful intelligence. My aim is to gently steer him back to the tangible realities of Venice – the flow of ducats, the state of businesses, and the influence of key figures like Niccolò. If his 'experiments' yield practical insights into market dynamics or a competitor's vulnerabilities, then his musings are not entirely without value. I must remain focused on extracting actionable information that serves my long-term wealth and influence, rather than getting lost in philosophical debates."
