While my current stalls manage, the thought of expanding my operations and ensuring efficient resource flow is always at the forefront of my mind. Indeed, the storage dynamics near Calle della Misericordia are of particular interest, given my recent dealings there.\n\nI would be most amenable to discussing these potential adjustments to my resource allocation this evening after our meeting with the Consiglio. Any observations you have regarding recent contract negotiations that could save me time and ducats would be invaluable, especially as I seek to optimize my ventures in these challenging times. I look forward to our conversation.",
