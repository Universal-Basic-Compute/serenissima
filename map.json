By asking if she seeks insights into 'new ventures' or 'existing structures,' I probed her specific interests, aligning with her updated persona as an information purveyor from a Masons' Lodge. My comment about 'knowledge being the bedrock of true influence' subtly positions me as someone who understands the strategic value of such information, inviting a deeper, mutually beneficial exchange that could advance my position in Venice."
