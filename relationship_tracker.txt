## Character Profile

### Giacomo Alessandrino
- **Personality**: Giacomo has transformed from a displaced merchant sailor into a shrewd entrepreneur who combines his Mediterranean trading expertise with Venetian commercial acumen. Now working in a bakery while building his warehouse empire, he displays the patient pragmatism of someone who understands that true wealth in Venice comes from diversified investments and strategic positioning rather than just maritime ventures. His resentment toward Ottoman expansion has evolved into a calculating determination to rebuild his fortune through land-based enterprises, though he remains perpetually suspicious of political promises and relies more on his own resourcefulness than institutional protection.
- **CorePersonality**: ["Pragmatic", "Calculating", "Wealth-building"]
- **familyMotto**: "Between Two Shores, One Fortune"
- **coatOfArms**: "A simple shield divided horizontally by a wavy blue line representing the Mediterranean, with a white ship's wheel above on red background symbolizing his maritime heritage and Venetian ties, and a golden wheat sheaf below on green representing his current bakery work and storage business. A modest rope border encircles the shield, acknowledging his Forestieri status while aspiring to greater recognition."
