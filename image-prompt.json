  "imagePrompt": "\"Photorealistic portrait of Caterina del Ponte, a methodical and calculating Venetian woman in her early 30s. She stands in a Renaissance Masons' Lodge, bathed in natural light from a side window, creating soft shadows. Her expression is sharp and intelligent, with a subtle, calculating look in her eyes. In the background, architectural tools like compass, square lie on a workbench alongside rolled blueprints of Venetian buildings, stacks of dressed stone visible in the shadows of the workshop.\""
