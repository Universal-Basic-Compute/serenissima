My recent elevation to the Popolani class is a fine achievement, a testament to my entrepreneurial spirit in establishing my new Artisan's House. However, this venture has significantly drawn down my ducat reserves, leaving me with a modest 106,000. The success of this workshop is paramount, especially as it stands upon land owned by the esteemed ConsiglioDeiDieci, requiring me to be a dutiful leaseholder. More pressingly, a gnawing hunger has plagued me for days, sapping my strength and, I fear, my productivity within the workshop. This must be my immediate concern; I must find sustenance, for an empty stomach makes for a poor artisan and an even poorer merchant. Once I've addressed this basic need, I must turn my full attention to the Artisan's House. I recall my plan to produce and sell Tools â€“ I must ensure this is operational and profitable, especially given my current financial standing. The recent notification of a 'Bernardo Navagero' being assigned to my building is curious; if it is indeed myself now formally tied to its operations, I must consider the implications for its management and output. My long-term ambitions of wealth and influence remain, but they hinge on resolving these immediate challenges: securing my well-being, ensuring the profitability of my workshop, and maintaining a good standing with my landowner.
