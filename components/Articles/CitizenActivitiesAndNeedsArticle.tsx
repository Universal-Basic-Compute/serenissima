            Understanding the Rhythms and Requirements of Citizens in La Serenissima.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-serif text-amber-700 mb-4">A Simulated Existence</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            In La Serenissima, every citizen, whether AI-controlled or player-managed, leads a simulated life filled with activities and driven by fundamental needs. This system creates a dynamic and immersive Venice, where the populace isn't static but actively engages with the world around them. Understanding these mechanics is key to managing your own citizens effectively and interacting with the broader economy.
          </p>

          <div className="bg-amber-100 p-5 rounded-lg border border-amber-300 mb-6">
            <h4 className="text-xl font-serif text-amber-800 mb-3">Carrying Capacity and Porters</h4>
            <p className="mb-3 text-sm">
              Citizens in La Serenissima have a base carrying capacity, currently set at <strong>10 units</strong> of resources. This represents what an individual can reasonably transport without specialized equipment.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-3 text-sm">
              Historically, Venetian porters (`facchini`) were essential for moving goods through the city's narrow streets and over its many stepped bridges. With equipment like carrying frames (`gerle` - large baskets worn on the back) or yokes, a strong porter could carry significantly more â€“ often 50-70kg (double or triple what one might carry in a simple sack).
            </p>
            <p className="mb-3 text-sm">
              In future updates, "Porter's Equipment" might be introduced as an item or upgrade. If a citizen were equipped with such, their carrying capacity could increase substantially, perhaps to 25-30 units, allowing them to transport <strong>15-20 additional units</strong> per trip. This would make logistics and trade more efficient, especially for businesses relying on manual transport.

            <p className="mb-3">
              Every citizen in Venice strives to meet these fundamental requirements:

            <div className="grid md:grid-cols-3 gap-4">

                <h5 className="font-bold text-amber-900 mb-1">Housing</h5>
                <p className="text-sm">A place to live, appropriate to their social class. Essential for rest and well-being.</p>
              </div>

                <h5 className="font-bold text-amber-900 mb-1">Food</h5>
                <p className="text-sm">Regular meals to maintain health and productivity. Hunger impacts their ability to work effectively.</p>
              </div>

                <FaBriefcase className="text-3xl text-amber-700 mx-auto mb-2" />
                <h5 className="font-bold text-amber-900 mb-1">Employment</h5>
                <p className="text-sm">A job to earn Ducats, afford necessities, and contribute to the economy.</p>

            </div>
            <p className="mt-3 text-sm">
              Failure to meet these needs can lead to problems, such as homelessness or hunger, which in turn reduce a citizen's productivity and overall effectiveness. A hungry citizen suffers a 50% productivity reduction. A homeless citizen also suffers a 50% productivity reduction. If a citizen is both hungry and homeless, these penalties can stack, potentially reducing productivity to 25% or even lower. These issues will be flagged in the Problem system.

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-serif text-amber-700 mb-4">The Cycle of Daily Activities</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Citizens engage in a variety of activities throughout the day, managed by the game's engine. These activities are crucial for the functioning of the Venetian economy:
          </p>

          <div className="space-y-4">
            {[
              { icon: FaBed, title: "Rest", description: "During nighttime hours (typically 10 PM to 6 AM Venice time), citizens seek to rest, usually in their homes or an inn if they are visitors. Proper rest is vital for recuperation." },
              { icon: FaRoute, title: "Travel (Goto Activities)", description: "Citizens move between locations for various purposes. This includes `goto_home` to return to their residence, `goto_work` to travel to their workplace, and `goto_inn` for visitors seeking lodging. These activities use realistic pathfinding through Venice's streets and canals." },
              { icon: FaBriefcase, title: "Work", description: "Employed citizens spend their daytime hours at their assigned businesses. This is where they contribute to the economy and earn their wages. For service-oriented businesses like Warehouses, 'work' might involve general upkeep, ensuring the facility is operational for clients, and administrative tasks rather than direct production of goods." },
              { icon: FaCog, title: "Production", description: "While at their workplace, citizens may engage in 'production' activities. This involves transforming input resources into output resources according to specific recipes, forming the backbone of Venice's industry. The processor consumes inputs and adds outputs if conditions are met." },
              { icon: FaUtensils, title: "Eating Activities", description: "Triggered when a citizen's `AteAt` timestamp is older than 12 hours. Can be `eat_from_inventory` (consumes food they carry), `eat_at_home` (consumes food they own at home), or `eat_at_tavern` (pays Ducats for a meal). Travel may precede eating at home or a tavern." },
              { icon: FaRoute, title: "Fetch Resource", description: "Citizen travels to a source building (`FromBuilding`) to pick up resources as per a contract. Upon arrival, the buyer pays the seller, and the resource is transferred to the citizen's inventory (owned by the buyer), limited by their carrying capacity (base 10 units, potentially more with equipment) and funds. A subsequent `deliver_resource_batch` activity usually follows." },
              { icon: FaShip, title: "Fetch From Galley", description: "Citizen travels to a `merchant_galley` to pick up imported resources. Resources are transferred from the galley (owned by the merchant) to the citizen's inventory (owned by the original contract's buyer), respecting their carrying capacity. This triggers a `deliver_resource_batch` activity to the final buyer." },
              { icon: FaRoute, title: "Deliver Resource Batch", description: "Citizen transports resources (fetched from a galley or another building) to a final destination building. Upon arrival, resources are transferred, and financial transactions for the original contract are settled." },
              { icon: FaRoute, title: "Leave Venice", description: "A Forestiero (visitor) travels to an exit point. Upon arrival, their assets are liquidated, and their `InVenice` status is set to `FALSE`." },
              { icon: FaExclamationTriangle, title: "Idle", description: "If a citizen has no specific task, if pathfinding fails, or if prerequisite conditions for other activities aren't met (e.g., lack of input resources for production), they may become 'idle'. This is usually a temporary state before the system assigns a new activity." }
            ].map(activity => (
              <div key={activity.title} className="bg-amber-100 p-4 rounded-lg border border-amber-300 flex items-start">
                <activity.icon className="text-2xl text-amber-700 mr-4 mt-1 flex-shrink-0" />

                </div>
              </div>
            ))}
          </div>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-serif text-amber-700 mt-6 mb-4">Observing and Interacting</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Players can observe these activities in real-time on the game map. Citizens will be seen moving along paths, residing in buildings, or working at businesses. Clicking on a citizen or a building can provide more details about their current status and activities.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            While the system automates many of these activities for both AI and human-controlled citizens (if not actively managed), player decisions heavily influence them. For instance:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-6 text-sm">
            <li>Providing housing for your citizens prevents homelessness.</li>
            <li>Ensuring your businesses have necessary input resources enables production activities.</li>
            <li>Setting up contracts can trigger resource fetching activities.</li>
            <li>Managing your citizen's Ducats ensures they can afford food and rent.</li>
          </ul>

          <div className="mt-8 p-6 bg-amber-200 rounded-lg border border-amber-400">
            <h4 className="text-xl font-serif text-amber-800 mb-2">A Living Economy</h4>
            <p className="text-amber-800">
              The interplay of citizen needs and activities creates a vibrant, self-regulating economy. A well-housed, well-fed, and employed populace is a productive one. By understanding and catering to these fundamental aspects of Venetian life, players can foster thriving communities and successful enterprises.
