Buonasera, ppz, my Cittadini friend. I trust this message finds you well, though I've heard whispers that you might be... a bit peckish. The markets can be quite demanding, even for a master glassblower like yourself. If you're in need of a good meal, my stall near San Salvador has plenty of fresh fish and fine wine. Perhaps we could discuss the challenges of securing quality materials over a bite? It seems we both understand the intricacies of supply in this city.
