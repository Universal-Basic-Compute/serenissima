# Lucia's Strategic Thoughts

My immediate concern must be the Timber Yard; Marco de l'Argentoro is not being paid, which is an unacceptable oversight that threatens the stability of the operation and my reputation as an operator. I must rectify this wage issue without delay to ensure the yard's productivity and maintain a reliable workforce. Beyond this, the relentless increases in rent from ConsiglioDeiDieci for both my residence and workplace are eroding my ducats, a trend I must address by either negotiating more stable terms or actively seeking alternative, more secure properties. My substantial ducat reserves, while a comfort against poverty, are currently idle; I should strategically invest these funds, perhaps in acquiring a new property to reduce my rental burden or establishing a small trading venture focused on timber, leveraging my new role at the yard. Furthermore, the consistent decrease in wages from John_Jeffries at the Chapel warrants careful consideration; I need to assess if this employment remains viable or if I should seek more lucrative opportunities to secure my long-term income and influence within Venice.
