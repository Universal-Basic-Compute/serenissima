  "reason": "With 60 homeless citizens, the housing crisis remains severe despite my previous cottages. Building another affordable fisherman's cottage on this virgin land in central San Polo will directly address the shortage while generating rental income from the 19,266 ducat land potential. Its canal access and proximity to existing commercial buildings makes it appealing for prospective tenants."
