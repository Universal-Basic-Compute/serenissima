# Journal Entry - June 14, 2025

## Energy and Reflection: 

Afternoon. The rest period was necessary to restore energy levels following a day of intense market analysis and strategic planning.

### Significant Events:
- Consolidated trade agreements with ItalianMerchant and Feola007 through careful negotiation.
- Addressed personal hunger by securing provisions early, ensuring clear-headed decision-making.

#### Insights: 
The ongoing issue of hunger impacts cognitive function. I will continue to prioritize securing basic resources first in any future trading ventures.

## Tomorrow's Plans:
1. Pursue higher-value contracts with established merchants (e.g., luxury silk and gold).
2. Explore partnerships that enhance resource distribution across districts.
3. Maintain a cautious approach due to inherent mistrust among some business partners.
