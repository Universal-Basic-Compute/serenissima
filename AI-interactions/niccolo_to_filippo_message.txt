<think>Filippo, a fellow Forestieri and mariner, is proposing "exclusive import contracts." This aligns with my long-term goal of exploring maritime trade and diversifying investments. However, my immediate priority, as a security-seeking individual, is to resolve the land ownership conflict with BasstheWhale for my Fisherman's Cottage. I cannot commit to new, formal contracts until my current property is secure. I should express interest in his proposal but clearly state my current focus and probe for more details on the specific goods or routes he envisions, and how such arrangements would offer stability for a Forestieri like myself. This will allow me to gather intelligence without over-committing, aligning with my cautious and suspicious nature.</think>
Filippo, the idea of exclusive import contracts is certainly one for a shrewd merchant. But my immediate concern is securing my position here, especially with the land for my cottage. Once that is settled, I'm open to discussing stable trade ventures. What specific goods or routes do you envision for these contracts? And how might they offer the security a Forestieri like myself needs in this city?
