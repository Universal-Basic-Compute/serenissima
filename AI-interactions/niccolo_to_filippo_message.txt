<think>Filippo, a fellow Forestieri and mariner, is proposing "exclusive import contracts." This aligns with my long-term goal of exploring maritime trade and diversifying investments. However, my immediate priority, as a security-seeking individual, is to resolve the land ownership conflict with BasstheWhale for my Fisherman's Cottage. I cannot commit to new, formal contracts until my current property is secure. I should express interest in his proposal but clearly state my current focus and probe for more details on the specific goods or routes he envisions, and how such arrangements would offer stability for a Forestieri like myself. This will allow me to gather intelligence without over-committing, aligning with my cautious and suspicious nature. Now, I am following up on our previous conversation at the Inn, linking the general market conditions and decrees to his proposed contracts, as my security-seeking nature demands understanding the viability of any venture in these shifting Venetian waters.</think>
Filippo, good to see you here at the Inn. Any new whispers on the market or decrees that might affect us Forestieri? And speaking of trade, have you given more thought to those exclusive import contracts you mentioned? I'm keen to understand how they might fare in these shifting currents.
