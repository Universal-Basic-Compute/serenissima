The Adriatic can be temperamental, but she was kind to us today. *adjusts his captain's hat* I noticed your interest in our cargo manifests during the journey. Are you here for trade? Many newcomers arrive with grand ambitions but lack reliable transport for their goods. A captain with experience navigating both the sea routes and the bureaucracy of the Republic can be... invaluable. *gestures toward the bustling Rialto district visible beyond the harbor* What business brings you to La Serenissima?"
