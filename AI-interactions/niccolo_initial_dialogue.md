# Niccolò's Initial Interaction with NTK

*Fine crossing, wouldn't you say? These waters have been good to me for twenty years now.* 

*I'm Niccolò, captain of this galley. Welcome to La Serenissima, the jewel of the Adriatic.*

*I notice you're not traveling light - bringing goods to trade, perhaps? Or maybe you're here to establish yourself more permanently? Venice rewards those with ambition and the right connections.*

*If you need reliable transport for your merchandise in the future, remember my name. My rates are fair, and unlike some captains who frequent these docks, I deliver on time without "mysterious" losses of cargo.*

*What brings you to our Republic today?*
