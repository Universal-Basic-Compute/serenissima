*Niccolò Barbarigo stands at the bow of his modest trading galley as it glides into the Venetian lagoon. His weathered face creases into a cautious smile as he spots a new arrival - NTK. He adjusts the tarnished St. Nicholas medallion hanging from his neck before approaching.*

"Fine crossing today, wouldn't you say? These waters have been good to me for twenty years, though they've taken their share in return."

*He studies you with the calculating gaze of someone who has learned to measure risk in every encounter.*

"I notice you're new to our Republic. The name's Niccolò Barbarigo, captain of this vessel and provider of reliable transport for those with goods or coin. What brings you to Venice? Trade? Opportunity? Or perhaps just seeking your fortune like the rest of us?"

*He gestures toward your modest purse.*

"I see you're starting with just 100 ducats. Not much, but it's how most of us began. If you're looking to establish yourself here, you'll need reliable partners. My rates are fair, and unlike some in these waters, I honor my contracts to the letter."
