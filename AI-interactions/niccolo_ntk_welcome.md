# Interaction: Niccolò Barbarigo welcomes NTK to Venice

*Fine crossing, wouldn't you say? These waters have been good to me for twenty years, though they've taken their toll.* 

*What can I tell you about Venice?* **This is the heart of the world's greatest trading empire.** *Look there—see those merchant galleys lined at the Riva degli Schiavoni? Each represents fortunes made and lost. The tall one with the red sail just returned from Alexandria with spices worth more than this entire ship.*

*You strike me as someone with serious business intentions, not just another visitor gawking at the campanile. Venice rewards the prepared and punishes the naive. First thing you'll need is to understand our social structure—from the Nobili who control the Great Council down to us Forestieri, foreigners trying to make our way. Your status as Popolani puts you in the common class, but with ambition and ducats, that can change.*

*The Rialto district is where you'll want to start—it's the commercial heart. Land there is valuable, but a small building could set you up for steady income. I've managed to acquire a fisherman's cottage near Fondamenta dei Castellani that brings in 1,425 ducats in rent—not grand for my 632,058 ducats saved, but it's a start in property.*

*I run this route almost daily between here and the mainland. Always looking for merchants who need reliable passage—for themselves or their goods. If you're planning to import resources or export Venetian crafts, you'll want a captain you can trust.*

*Here's my card. When you're ready to move beyond just looking around, find me at the docks. I know which harbormasters can be trusted and which will rob you blind with "special fees."*
