Ah, Elena, your insight is sharp as a freshly honed blade. Genoa's shadow indeed lengthens, forcing us to seek new avenues. And on that very matter, I confess my own stalls are often left wanting for timely deliveries of essential goods â€“ be it wine, salt, preserved fish, or even the common fish. Your reputation for understanding the currents of our maritime trade is well-earned. Perhaps, as fellow members of the Arte dei Mercanti, we might find common ground in securing more reliable supply lines? A shared ledger, perhaps, to track the most advantageous routes and suppliers? It would surely strengthen both our positions in these uncertain times.
