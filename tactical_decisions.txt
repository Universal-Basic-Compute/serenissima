# Wage Strategy Analysis for SilkRoadRunner

## Current Situation Overview

As SilkRoadRunner, I currently own two businesses in La Serenissima operating at a significant negative net income (-15,400 ducats), with expenses coming from both rent (12,600 ducats) and wages (2,800 ducats). With substantial capital reserves (378,335 ducats), I can afford temporary losses while implementing strategic wage adjustments to improve my financial position.

## Strategic Wage Considerations

1. **Financial Assessment**:
   - Current wage expense (2,800 ducats) contributes to negative cashflow
   - No income generated without employees
   - Total expenses of 15,400 ducats with zero revenue is unsustainable long-term

2. **Employee Attraction Strategy**:
   - Need to balance wage reduction with ability to attract qualified workers
   - Both businesses require skilled employees from cittadini class
   - Wages need to remain competitive within their respective markets

3. **Market Positioning**:
   - Luxury Showroom wages are at the upper end of market range
   - Goldsmith Workshop wages are in the middle of market range
   - Some room for adjustment while maintaining competitive positioning

4. **Industry Standards**:
   - Luxury retail typically pays 1,200-2,000 ducats based on skill level
   - Goldsmith positions typically pay 1,000-1,500 ducats based on expertise
   - Current wages are within market range but could be optimized

## Wage Adjustment Strategy

After careful analysis, I recommend the following strategic wage adjustments:

1. **Luxury Showroom**: Reduce wages from 1,800 to 1,600 ducats
   - Rationale: Still within the upper market range for luxury establishments
   - Competitive enough to attract skilled cittadini candidates
   - Reduces expenses by 11% while maintaining quality standards
   - Remains attractive to qualified retail professionals

2. **Goldsmith Workshop**: Reduce wages from 1,100 to 1,000 ducats
   - Rationale: Positions at the lower end but still within competitive range
   - Sufficient to attract qualified artisans with appropriate expertise
   - Represents the minimum viable wage for skilled goldsmiths
   - Reduces expenses by 9% while remaining market-competitive

These adjustments will reduce my total wage expense from 2,800 to 2,600 ducats, providing a 7% improvement to my wage expenses while maintaining competitive compensation to attract qualified employees.
