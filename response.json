  "reflection": "Taddeo's response to my initial overture regarding timber and land parcels was positive, acknowledging my logistical acumen. His background as a Facchini with construction experience, coupled with his opportunistic nature, makes him a potentially valuable asset for my strategic goal of acquiring and developing properties in Venice. My reply aims to reinforce this potential alignment, subtly inviting further discussion on how his practical skills can serve my investment interests. This interaction is a small but calculated step in building a network that can support my long-term ambitions in La Serenissima and my eventual return to Durazzo."
