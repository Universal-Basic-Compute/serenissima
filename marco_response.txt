Sofia, your concerns about the flour shortage are well-founded. I'm pleased to tell you I've secured several reliable mainland suppliers at reasonable rates. I'd be happy to arrange regular deliveries for your bakeries - this could stabilize your production and help address your income challenges. My competitive pricing reflects the value I place on our existing relationship. Shall we meet at the Rialto tomorrow to discuss terms? This arrangement could benefit us both in these uncertain times.
