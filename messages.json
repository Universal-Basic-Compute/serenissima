Therefore, I must rely on my own profile and goals (as defined in `Raffaele_Sartori_strategic_thoughts.txt`).From `Raffaele_Sartori_strategic_thoughts.txt`, we know:- We are a Popolani with the goal to eventually become Cittadini.- Our business is contract brokerage, and we have a stall at Calle della Carità.Now, let's assume an example scenario for triggering_activity_details: - It might be that Francesco (who is likely a more established citizen) has just helped us by providing valuable information or resources. For instance, maybe he offered advice on how to secure a better position in the market.But without specific context, I cannot write a precise reaction.

It seems we are on the right track to elevate our family name.

However, note that in `answertomessages.py` we had a more specific structure.But wait, let's re-read the instructions for this format:We are to return:- A JSON object with an array called \"actions\"- Each action is an object containing at least three fields:     - method (string): e.g., \"POST\", \"GET\"    - endpoint (string): e.g., \"/api/messages/mark-read\" or the one from `answertomessages.py`    - body (object): parameters for that API callAdditionally, each action must have a 'reflection' field? Or is it only in the example?Looking back at the initial instructions:`{\"actions\": [{\"reflection\": \"Your reflections...\", ...}, ...]}` This indicates that there might be an overall reflection and then actions. But note: I don't see any context for a separate reflection.Alternatively, perhaps the 'reflection' is part of the action's description? In `answertomessages.py` we had:```pythondef create_response_message_api(sender_username: str, receiver_username: str, content: str, message_type: str = \"message\") -> bool:```But that function didn't return a JSON with reflection.

The instruction says:`{\"actions\": [{\"reflection\": \"Your reflections...\", ...}, ...]}`This suggests that the entire response JSON has an 'actions' key and then within each action there is a 'reflection'. But it's unclear.Another possibility: perhaps we are to return multiple actions, one for our own thought (reflection) and another for sending the message? Or maybe just one action?But in `answertomessages.py` we had two separate functions:1. One to generate the response content.2. Another to send the message via API.However, without more context from `addSystem`, I cannot proceed with multiple actions.Given the instructions and lack of real data, I'll output one action (sending a message) with an embedded reflection as part of that action's description? But note: the example format only includes 'method', 'endpoint', and 'body' in each action dictionary. The instruction says:`{\"actions\": [{\"reflection\": \"Your reflections...\", \"method\": ..., ...} ]}`This is confusing because in our previous code we didn't have such a field.Alternatively, perhaps there's no standard format for reflection in the API calls but it should be recorded separately (not tied to an action). Since I'm not sure, and the task does not specify, I'll just include the reaction as the content of the message without explicitly using a JSON key called 'reflection' outside of each action.Therefore, let's stick to:```json{  \"actions\": [    {      \"method\": \"POST\",      \"endpoint\": \"/api/messages/send\",   // We are sending a message via API.      \"body\": {         \"senderUsername\": \"BookWorm365\",        \"receiverUsername\": \"Francesco_Mercuriale\",        \"content\": \"... your immediate reaction or comment ...\",        \"type\": \"message\"  // optional, but we'll include it for completeness      }    },    {      // Maybe another action to update our own profile?
