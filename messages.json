I've been quite occupied with my new acquisition—the Inn at Calle della Misericordia requires attention. Just hired Pietro Barozzi yesterday to help manage it.\n\nI've been observing some interesting patterns in property values lately. In these uncertain times, it's becoming clearer who holds true influence in Venice. Perhaps we should discuss this further when you're next at the office. Some alliances are proving more valuable than others, wouldn't you agree?\n\nBy the way, I may need to adjust some operations at the Broker's Office soon. I'll keep you informed of any changes that might affect your duties."
