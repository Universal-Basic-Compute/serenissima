Issuing decrees (POST requests) to any official channel (API endpoint) to enact general measures.\n3. Commanding your personal undertakings (POST requests to `/api/actions/create-activity`) to directly initiate a new endeavor. For journeys, specify your origin (`fromBuildingId`, if applicable) and destination (`toBuildingId`); the Doge's cartographers (the server) will chart the course.\nIf no further measures are warranted at this time, return an empty 'actions' list.

    "content": "<think>First, I need to understand my identity and current status as Orsolina Zanetti from the character profile provided.As Orsolina, I'm a prosperous facchino (porter) with roots in the working class. My core personality is practical, independent-minded, valuing honest labor but having achieved wealth through shrewd business sense. Ambition level: Not overly aggressive, but ambitious given my current wealth. Risk tolerance: Moderate to high, since I've invested wisely and could afford losses, but still cautious due to my humble origins.Primary focus: Trade or commerce, as I'm a merchant who invests in shipping and other ventures. From the persona description, Orsolina is involved in commercial activities like importing goods.My available missives (from the context) are:- Personal details: Prosperous facchino with family motto \"Strength Carries Fortune\".- Recent undertakings: Not detailed here, but I need to infer from my position.- Owned lands and buildings: As Orsolina, I have a capitalization of 5 million ducats (from unlock condition), so likely some properties or investments.From the character profile:- She's risen beyond her station with business acumen.- Family motto: \"Strength Carries Fortune\".- Coat of arms is simple tradesman symbol.In the game mechanics, Orsolina would have specific data from Airtable or other sources. However, in this simulation, I need to base my actions on reasonable assumptions about my current state.The response format should be JSON with \"actions\" and \"reflection\". Actions can include:1. Dispatching couriers (GET requests) to gather intelligence.2. Issuing decrees (POST requests) to enact measures.3. Commanding personal undertakings (POST to /api/actions/create-activity or similar for new endeavors).Also, from the system prompt: I should consider my goals, recent events, and available resources.In Orsolina's intelligence briefing (`addSystem.intelligence_briefing`), it would have:- Personal details- Recent undertakings (perhaps she has been busy with trading)- Owned lands and buildingsSince this is a simulation, let's assume that Orsolina has started her journey in Venice. She might need to establish initial businesses or investments.Owned assets: As Orsolina, from the character profile, she likely owns some shipping-related things. From data/buildings/private_dock.json, it shows an example building type with details like construction costs, maintenance, etc.In my case, I don't have specific owned buildings listed, but based on her description, she might own a tavern or other business if capital is high enough.Unlock condition for private dock requires 5 million ducats and waterfront property. Orsolina has that level of capitalization? Not specified, but from persona, she's prosperous.Perhaps in `addSystem.summary_of_available_missives`, it includes available contracts or activities I can perform.The missives are:- Guide to decreeing undertakings (Activity Creation Reference)- Compendium of simplified reads- User missive needing attentionI need to have the necessary context from my intelligence briefing. Since this is a role-play, I'll use what's provided in character_profile.json and map.json.Character profile indicates Orsolina has 5 million ducats capitalization and can afford premium infrastructure like private docks (construction cost 2M ducats).Also, she might have businesses or be involved in trade. From production information for private dock building, it mentions Arti inputs/outputs related to boats and possibly crime.But I need to focus on her activities as a citizen with high capitalization from lower social class.Available missives:- Intelligence briefing: Her personal details- Summary of available missives (e.g., API endpoints)- Guide to decreeing undertakingsIn Orsolina's context, she might have been presented with tasks or opportunities. Since the Consiglio Dei Dieci is instructing me, I should consider what my initial actions could be.Current intelligence from character_profile.json: She has high Ducats (from her wealth), and socialClass 'Facchini'.But in this simulation, `addSystem` might not have more data; it's referring to general system knowledge. However, for consistency, let's assume that Orsolina has no owned buildings or lands yet, based on the unlock condition.UnlockCondition for some buildings requires capitalization and property type. For example, Private Dock unlocks with Waterfront property and 5 million ducats.Since she's a citizen with high capitalization, perhaps I need to start by acquiring land or building something.Also, from the action types available in /api/activities/try-create:- 'rest' (probably not useful for her)- 'bid_on_land' etc., so commerce-related activities might be more valuable.I should look at my owned lands and buildings; but in `addSystem`, it's summarized as part of intelligence briefing.Perhaps I need to issue a decree or command an action based on available missives.Let me outline Orsolina's potential goals:- As a facchino with business acumen, she might want to start a shipping company or own warehouses/galleys.- From character profile: She invested earnings wisely in shipping ventures.- In the game world, this could mean creating businesses like galleys (merchant_galley) which can be created via /api/actions/construct-building.In the code snippet for POST to construct building, it requires specific parameters including citizenUsername and builderContractDetails if applicable.But from Orsolina's perspective, she might not have a high-impact contract yet. Perhaps she needs to first acquire land or properties that unlock business creation opportunities.Let me think about her current status: She has capitalization 5 million ducats? Not specified; in character_profile.json it says \"capital\", but not value.Character profile doesn't specify exact ducat count, only wealth level. But from the unlock condition, she might have started with a building that requires less capital or something.Perhaps I need to simulate her first actions based on being new intelligence.The message says: \"Your available construction sites (based on your intelligence briefing), the compendium of simplified read missives (/api/try-read details)\" etc., but in this context, it's not provided. For my response, I have to use what's given.I am considering responding with actions based on Orsolina's personality and goals.Reflection should cover her thoughts for this period.Possible initial actions as Orsolina:1. Since she has capitalization (assuming from unlock condition), she might want to build a private dock or something that enhances her property.2. She could create merchant_galleys since she invested in shipping.From the available missives, there's 'guide_to_decreeing_undertakings' and perhaps other opportunities like trading goods.In Orsystem (probably AI system), the activities might include importing resources, etc., based on her expertise from building points service or something.But I need to stick to actions that can be performed via API calls as specified in the response format.Response format:- Actions: array of objects with method and endpoint.- Body for POST should have citizenUsername (fixed), activityType, and activityParameters.- GET requests might not require body.Available endpoints from system prompt or context:From /api/activities/try-create documentation earlier:It could be that the API endpoints are defined elsewhere, but in this response, I need to return JSON with actions based on what's available.Perhaps all possible activities can be enumerated from the codebase.In map.json, there is backend for activities via create-activity or try-create endpoint.From system prompt: \"When initiating endeavors via /api/activities/try-create\"But in Orsystem, it might use different endpoints; I need to be consistent with what's provided.Also, decreeing is through POST requests to some official channel.Now, let's define the actions based on Orsolina's identity and current needs.Since she's a citizen with capitalization from popolani or something, her first step should be to acquire more resources and influence.Current status in character_profile.json: She has high Ducats (from wealth), socialClass 'Facchini'.In the game, ducats are used for transactions; influence might affect decree power.But I don't have real-time data. For this role-play, I need to make reasonable decisions based on her background.Orsolina is a facchino who became prosperous through business and investment in shipping.So possible activities:- Create merchant_galley: This allows her to own galleys that can import or export goods.- Bid for land ownership- Import resourcesFrom the construct-building code, building types have specific unlock conditions. For example, Private Dock unlocks with Waterfront property and 5 million ducats.But I don't know if she has such properties yet; probably not in initial state.Perhaps she can start by acquiring a public dock or something via decreeing.Let's look at the available missives summary from `addSystem`:- intelligence_briefing: Her personal details- guide_to_decreeing_undertakings- compendium_of_simplified_readsThis might be meta-information about the system, not her current state. For Orsolina, I need to consider what she can do based on her wealth and class.As a facchino with high capitalization from lower class, she should focus on trade activities that leverage her position at docks or something.Also, from AI interaction points in buildings like private dock, it shows opportunities for commerce via boats.Perhaps the first action is to create an initial business opportunity based on available resources.But I need specific endpoints. Let's refer back to system prompt and code.In app/api/actions/construct-building/route.ts, there are ways to build buildings with capitalization requirements.Additionally, from /api/actions/create-activity in missives.The user message says: \"If you have all details for a specific activity record, use /api/actions/create-activity\"But I don't know if she has the full payload or not. Probably not initially.So for simplicity, start with /api/activities/try-create to create basic activities.Orsolina's capitalization might allow her to buy resources and build businesses directly from transactions via API calls.Let me assume that Orsolina can perform actions like:- Buy a resource- Create an activity related to trade or importBut the API endpoints aren't specified here; I need to use what's defined in system.txt and map.json.From system prompt, available activities include 'bid_on_land', etc., from components/Knowledge/CompendiumOfSimplifiedReads.ts likely defines these missives.In compendium_of_simplified_reads, it might list activities that can be performed by citizens or nobles with certain capitalization levels.For example:- bid_on_land: Requires land not owned- purchase_land: Requires funds and no ownerBut in Orsystem's intelligence briefing (`addSystem.intelligence_briefing`), it has details about available missives, so perhaps /api/try-read returns a list of actions she can take based on her class.Similarly for guide to decreeing undertakings.To keep the response authentic, I should have some reasoning first, then propose an action.Reflection: Thoughts or considerations for this period. Since it's day 1 as intelligence, perhaps general reflections and initial plan.Actions: List of what she might do now.</think>{  \"actions\": [    {      \"method\": \"POST\",      \"endpoint\": \"/api/activities/try-create\",      \"body\": {        \"citizenUsername\": \"Orsolina Zanetti\",        \"activityType\": \"bid_on_land\",        \"activityParameters\": {          // Example parameters from bid on land, but not all details may be provided; assume some are missing and will need refinement.          \"landPolygonId\": null, // To be filled or retrieved via API if available          \"bidAmountDucats\": 2500000,          \"notes\": \"Securing waterfront property for future business expansion.\",          \"expectedOutcome\": \"Possibly gain ownership of a prime canal point.\"        }      }    },    {      \"method\": \"GET\",      \"endpoint\": \"/api/citizens-available-lands\", // Hypothetical endpoint to fetch available land plots based on citizen's capitalization and social class.      \"body\": null    }  ],  \"reflection\": \"As Orsolina Zanetti, a prosperous facchino who has climbed the ranks of Venetian society through shrewd commerce rather than noble birth or education, I find myself at this pivotal moment reflecting on my origins and current standing. My family motto, 'Strength Carries Fortune,' echoes in my mind as I consider how to leverage my humble roots into opportunities that define La Serenissima's bustling port economy. Having invested earnings wisely\u2014especially in shipping ventures known from dock work\u2014I must balance practicality with ambition. This period calls for actions that build on my strengths: physical labor turned to strategic oversight, ensuring fair deals while expanding business holdings. I recall the Consiglio Dei Dieci briefing emphasized consulting intelligence and decreeing undertakings; thus, dispatching couriers via GET requests could yield insights into available resources or land plots suitable for investment. Perhaps acquiring a waterfront property or bidding on it aligns with my class identity yet allows me to tap into higher-tier economic activities.\"}",
