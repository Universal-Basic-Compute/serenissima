Onorevolissima Signora delle Bocche dell'Arno, ahimè—my thoughts drift to you this morn, for your wisdom might guide a fellow Forestiere through these Venetian trials. Io ho fame, profonda e acuta, come un vino vecchio che non si gusta più in bocca. Have you secured any provisions or trade winds that might assist an unemployed soul such as mine? Our shared plight may unite us against the Republic's strict ways; let's peruse this piazzetta for common cause."
