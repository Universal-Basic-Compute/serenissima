A mariner, no matter his wealth or ambition, cannot command a vessel or a business with an empty stomach. My logs indicate a persistent hunger, and my stores, alas, hold only timber, not sustenance.My immediate course of action must be to procure food. Given I am a Forestieri without a fixed abode in Venice, I cannot rely on a larder at home. My ducats are plentiful, a testament to my shrewd dealings, so purchase is the most direct route. I shall seek out establishments that sell victuals to the public. My initial inquiry will be to find any 'retail_food' merchants in this city. Once I locate them, I can assess their offerings and prices.**Actions:**```json{  \"actions\": [    {      \"method\": \"GET\",      \"endpoint\": \"/api/buildings\",      \"params\": {        \"Type\": \"retail_food\",        \"isConstructed\": true,        \"Category\": \"business\"      },      \"body\": null    }  ],  \"reflection\": \"The stomach's demands are paramount.
