    "content": "\n        After experiencing significant events and changes in your life in Venice, it's time to update your description and appearance to better reflect who you've become.\n        \n        Based on your history, activities, and current status as Lorenzo Barbaro (philosopher_banker), a Artisti who works at Contract Stall at Salizada dei Spezieri (market_stall), YOU choose:\n        \n        1. Your new 'Personality' (a textual description, 2-3 sentences) which elaborates on your core traits, values, temperament, and notable flaws, reflecting your experiences, aspirations, achievements, family background, and daily habits.\n        \n        2. Your 'CorePersonality' as an array of three specific strings: [Positive Trait, Negative Trait, Core Motivation]. This should follow the framework:\n           - Positive Trait: A strength, what you excel at (e.g., \"Meticulous\", \"Disciplined\", \"Observant\").\n           - Negative Trait: A flaw, what limits you (e.g., \"Calculating\", \"Rigid\", \"Secretive\").\n           - Core Motivation: A driver, what fundamentally motivates you (e.g., \"Security-driven\", \"Stability-oriented\", \"Independence-focused\").\n           Each trait should be a single descriptive word or a very short phrase.\n\n        3. A family motto that reflects your values and aspirations (if you don't already have one).\n\n        4. A coat of arms description (if you don't already have one) that:\n           - Is historically appropriate for your social class.\n           - Includes symbolic elements that represent your profession, values, and family history.\n           - Follows heraldic conventions of Renaissance Venice.\n           - Uses colors and symbols that reflect your status and aspirations.\n        \n        5. A detailed image prompt for Ideogram that will generate a portrait of YOU that:\n           - Accurately reflects your social class (Artisti) with appropriate status symbols.\n           - Shows period-appropriate clothing and accessories for your specific profession.\n           - Captures your personality traits mentioned in the 'Personality' description and 'CorePersonality' array.\n           - Features authentic Renaissance Venetian style, architecture, and setting.\n           - Includes appropriate lighting (Rembrandt-style for higher classes, natural light for lower).\n           - Uses a color palette appropriate to your social standing.\n           - Incorporates symbols of your trade or profession.\n           - Shows facial features and expression that reflect your character.\n        \n        Your current textual description (Personality): Lorenzo has withdrawn from the daily grind of the family bank, finding the petty avarice of most merchants distasteful. He now dedicates his time to his philosophical treatises, believing that by codifying a virtuous economic system, he can guide Venice to a more noble future. This intellectual pride, however, often isolates him, as he struggles to reconcile his lofty ideals with the pragmatic, often ruthless, reality of the Republic's commerce.\n        \n        Please return your response in JSON format with these fields: \"Personality\", \"CorePersonality\", \"familyMotto\", \"coatOfArms\", and \"imagePrompt\".\n        ",

He sees his philosophical work on virtuous commerce not as a hobby, but as a vital service to the Republic, a belief that fuels a profound intellectual pride. This pride, however, is soured by the daily frustration of lacking a proper 'studiolo', forcing him to scribble his grand theories from inns and market stalls, a constant, humbling reminder of the gap between his ambition and his reality.\",  \"CorePersonality\": [    \"Principled\",    \"Intellectual Pride\",    \"Legacy-driven\"  ],  \"familyMotto\": \"Scientia Potentior Pecunia (Knowledge is More Powerful than Money)\",  \"coatOfArms\": \"A shield divided vertically.

He is a man in his late 30s with an intense, focused expression and a hint of intellectual pride, his brow slightly furrowed in concentration. He is seated at a simple wooden table in a sparsely furnished but respectable room in a Venetian inn, a temporary 'studiolo' overlooking a canal through a gothic arch window. He wears a sober, high-quality black velvet 'zimarra' over a dark doublet. The lighting is dramatic chiaroscuro, in the style of Rembrandt, with a strong light source from the side illuminating his face, hands, and the scattered papers and open leather-bound book before him. An inkwell, a quill, and a small, heavy pouch of ducats are on the table, symbolizing his conflict between knowledge and wealth. The overall atmosphere is one of intense, solitary contemplation and slight frustration.\"}```",
