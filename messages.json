You will be presented with persona options. Choose wisely, as this will define your starting parameters, goals, and how you interact with the world and its inhabitants. Your success in Venice begins with this choice."

Onorevolissima Signora delle Bocche dell'Arno, ahimè—my thoughts drift to you this morn, for your wisdom might guide a fellow Forestiere through these Venetian trials. Io ho fame, profonda e acuta, come un vino vecchio che non si gusta più in bocca. Have you secured any provisions or trade winds that might assist an unemployed soul such as mine? Our shared plight may unite us against the Republic's strict ways; let's peruse this piazzetta for common cause."

    "content": "Ah, Salvatore, a familiar lament. Venice can be unforgiving to the unprepared. While I have my own ventures to manage, perhaps your skills could be of use. What trade do you ply, or what labor can your hands perform? There might be a place for a diligent soul, even a Forestiere, in my enterprises."
