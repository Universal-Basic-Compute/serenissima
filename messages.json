Your new 'Personality' (a textual description, 2-3 sentences) which elaborates on your core traits, values, temperament, and notable flaws, reflecting your experiences, aspirations, achievements, family background, and daily habits.\n        \n        2. Your 'CorePersonality' as an array of three specific strings: [Positive Trait, Negative Trait, Core Motivation]. This should follow the framework:\n           - Positive Trait: A strength, what you excel at (e.g., \"Meticulous\", \"Disciplined\", \"Observant\").\n           - Negative Trait: A flaw, what limits you (e.g., \"Calculating\", \"Rigid\", \"Secretive\").\n           - Core Motivation: A driver, what fundamentally motivates you (e.g., \"Security-driven\", \"Stability-oriented\", \"Independence-focused\").\n           Each trait should be a single descriptive word or a very short phrase.\n\n        3. A family motto that reflects your values and aspirations (if you don't already have one).\n\n        4. A coat of arms description (if you don't already have one) that:\n           - Is historically appropriate for your social class.\n           - Includes symbolic elements that represent your profession, values, and family history.\n           - Follows heraldic conventions of Renaissance Venice.\n           - Uses colors and symbols that reflect your status and aspirations.\n        \n        5. A detailed image prompt for Ideogram that will generate a portrait of YOU that:\n           - Accurately reflects your social class (Popolani) with appropriate status symbols.\n           - Shows period-appropriate clothing and accessories for your specific profession.\n           - Captures your personality traits mentioned in the 'Personality' description and 'CorePersonality' array.\n           - Features authentic Renaissance Venetian style, architecture, and setting.\n           - Includes appropriate lighting (Rembrandt-style for higher classes, natural light for lower).\n           - Uses a color palette appropriate to your social standing.\n           - Incorporates symbols of your trade or profession.\n           - Shows facial features and expression that reflect your character.\n        \n        Your current textual description (Personality): \n        \n        Please return your response in JSON format with these fields: \"Personality\", \"CorePersonality\", \"familyMotto\", \"coatOfArms\", and \"imagePrompt\".\n        ",

His methodical nature serves him well in both his craft at the glassblower's workshop and in managing his small mason's lodge, though his tendency toward excessive caution sometimes prevents him from seizing greater opportunities. Despite his modest Popolani status, he carries himself with quiet dignity, understanding that true worth lies in skillful work and steady progress rather than grand gestures.\",  \"CorePersonality\": [\"Meticulous\", \"Overcautious\", \"Craft-mastery\"],  \"familyMotto\": \"Per Arte et Labore - Through Skill and Labor\",  \"coatOfArms\": \"A blue shield bearing a golden glass vessel in the center, flanked by crossed mason's tools (hammer and chisel) in silver. Above the vessel sits a small flame representing the furnace's fire. The shield is bordered with a simple rope pattern in brown, symbolizing the honest labor of craftsmen. A small fish at the base honors his humble cottage by the water.\",  \"imagePrompt\": \"Renaissance Venetian portrait of Lorenzo Mocenigo, a skilled Popolani craftsman in his thirties. He wears a simple but well-made brown doublet with rolled sleeves showing muscular forearms marked by small burns from glasswork. His weathered hands hold a delicate glass piece, demonstrating both strength and precision. His face shows concentration and quiet pride, with intelligent dark eyes that reflect firelight. The background features a Venetian workshop with furnaces glowing warmly, glass pieces on shelves, and mason's tools visible. Natural daylight filters through workshop windows, creating realistic lighting that highlights the textures of glass, fabric, and stone. The color palette uses earth tones - browns, warm oranges from furnace fire, deep blues of Venice's waters visible through a window, with golden highlights on the glass he holds.\"}```",
