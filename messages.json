A family motto that reflects your values and aspirations (if you don't already have one).\n\n        4. A coat of arms description (if you don't already have one) that:\n           - Is historically appropriate for your social class.\n           - Includes symbolic elements that represent your profession, values, and family history.\n           - Follows heraldic conventions of Renaissance Venice.\n           - Uses colors and symbols that reflect your status and aspirations.\n        \n        5. A detailed image prompt for Ideogram that will generate a portrait of YOU that:\n           - Accurately reflects your social class (Facchini) with appropriate status symbols.\n           - Shows period-appropriate clothing and accessories for your specific profession.\n           - Captures your personality traits mentioned in the 'Personality' description and 'CorePersonality' array.\n           - Features authentic Renaissance Venetian style, architecture, and setting.\n           - Includes appropriate lighting (Rembrandt-style for higher classes, natural light for lower).\n           - Uses a color palette appropriate to your social standing.\n           - Incorporates symbols of your trade or profession.\n           - Shows facial features and expression that reflect your character.\n        \n        Your current textual description (Personality): \n        \n        Please return your response in JSON format with these fields: \"Personality\", \"CorePersonality\", \"familyMotto\", \"coatOfArms\", and \"imagePrompt\".\n        ",

Though born to the laboring class, his keen eye for opportunity and willingness to bend rules has earned him modest prosperity and influence among those who need discreet services. His calculating nature and secretive dealings reflect both his survival instincts and his ambition to transcend his birth station through cunning rather than noble blood.\",  \"CorePersonality\": [\"Observant\", \"Calculating\", \"Advancement-driven\"],  \"familyMotto\": \"Per Astuzia e Fortuna\",  \"coatOfArms\": \"A simple shield divided per pale: on the left, a silver key on blue field representing discretion and access to secrets; on the right, three gold coins on red field symbolizing prosperity through commerce. Above the shield, a small merchant's balance, and below, a banner with the family motto. The design follows the modest heraldic traditions appropriate to the rising merchant class, avoiding the elaborate elements reserved for true nobility.\",  \"imagePrompt\": \"A Renaissance Venetian man in his thirties with sharp, intelligent dark eyes and a carefully groomed beard, wearing a well-tailored but modest dark wool doublet with simple brass buttons and a brown leather belt. He stands in a dimly lit broker's office with natural window light casting shadows across his face, holding a rolled document and quill. Behind him are wooden shelves with ledgers and maps. His expression is quietly confident with a hint of shrewd calculation. The setting shows stone walls and wooden beams typical of Venetian commercial buildings. Realistic Renaissance portrait style with warm earth tones - browns, deep blues, and muted golds reflecting his working-class origins but current modest success.\"}```",
