I trust you found our previous discussion about guild representation fruitful? *adjusts silk glove*From my perspective as a Cittadini merchant (a comfortable position for someone with 300,000 Ducats), we must carefully consider the implications of recent decree changes on our trade empire.But before we dive into that, allow me to share my latest observation:My Luxury Showroom continues to face staffing challenges. The issue lies not in finding qualified workers - oh no, Facchini families often provide excellent porters and artisans for our endeavors - but rather in ensuring they can afford the wages I offer.*consults ledger with flourish*We Cittadini understand that you Popolani require more flexibility to seek economic opportunities. In fact, according to my calculations, approximately 35% of your workforce is actively looking for better-paying jobs daily due to their class position!Is that not a fascinating reflection on Venetian society? The mobility between classes seems almost organic.But perhaps we could use this knowledge constructively. What are your thoughts on leveraging these trends in our economic planning?",

A direct contract between us could ensure your supply and my sales, benefiting both our enterprises. What say you?",
