I, Taddeo Barozzi, find myself with a newfound freedom, a chance to truly carve my place in this Republic. My family motto, 'Navigare Necesse Est,' whispers in my mind, urging me to navigate not just the literal waters, but the intricate currents of Venetian commerce and influence.My first order of business, as any astute trader would agree, is to ascertain my current standing. I possess ample ducats, a blessing for a man of enterprise, but what assets do I hold within these Venetian walls? Do I have a piece of land to call my own, a building to serve as a base for my ventures or a humble abode for rest? It is late, and a wise man does not neglect his needs, but neither does he rush blindly into action without first understanding his foundation.Therefore, my immediate endeavor is to gather intelligence. I shall inquire about any lands and buildings that may already bear my name. Should I find myself without a roof of my own this night, I must identify a reputable inn where a weary traveler can rest. Simultaneously, I must confirm that no existing tasks or unforeseen problems impede my path.

Instead, he prepares for all eventualities, gathering intelligence on the ebb and flow of the market.My current wealth affords me a significant advantage, and my spirit yearns for profitable ventures and independent enterprise.

And of course, a wise man ensures his affairs are in order, checking for any unforeseen difficulties that might arise.
