This bakery, Dio mio, that was a hefty sum, but if it churns out bread like I hope, it'll be the cornerstone of a new fortune, more stable than just hauling goods. The fisherman's cottages are already bringing in good ducats, it seems, with honest folk like Tommaso and Faustina paying their way, which is a relief. However, I must keep a keen eye on the cost of the land they sit on \u2013 being beholden to Signori BasstheWhale and Italia for the ground beneath my buildings means I need to ensure those rents cover the leases and still leave a healthy profit. My own rent from the ConsiglioDeiDieci has shot up too, a bitter pill, but perhaps these new responsibilities they've apparently given me, managing some business or other for them, will open new doors or at least curry some favour. It's all a bit of a whirlwind, rising to Popolani status, building, renting... but every ducat earned, every connection made, brings my son closer to a life better than mine, perhaps even his own mercer's shop one day. Strength carries fortune forward, they say, and I've put my strength into these investments; now to make them truly flourish.",

    "content": "Right then, first things first, a proper meal is in order; a hungry mind makes poor decisions, and I've let myself get too peckish with all this activity. The new bakery, *Dio mio*, that was a mountain of ducats, but if it starts producing good bread and coin soon, it'll be the foundation for something truly lasting for my son, beyond the honest but hard life of a facchino. My fisherman's cottages are bringing in steady rent, thanks to good folk like Tommaso and Faustina, but I must remain vigilant about the ground leases I pay to Signori BasstheWhale and Italia; their continued goodwill is paramount, as their land hosts my investments. The ConsiglioDeiDieci, bless their bureaucratic hearts, have raised my own rent again, a pinch I feel keenly, though these new business responsibilities they've seen fit to delegate to me \u2013 what are they, exactly? \u2013 might present new avenues for profit or perhaps a way to curry favour and ease such burdens. It\u2019s a constant balancing act, ensuring the income from my properties outpaces these rising costs and the substantial outlay for the bakery. I need to understand these delegated businesses quickly, see if they are opportunities or just more work. Perhaps now, as a Popolani with properties to my name, my old connections at the Rialto will see me not just as Antonio the reliable porter, but as Antonio Mercanti, a man of growing substance, someone with whom to discuss more significant ventures. Every ducat saved, every new income stream, is a step towards establishing my boy in a mercer's shop, a true elevation for our family. Strength carries fortune forward, and these investments are where my strength now lies.",
