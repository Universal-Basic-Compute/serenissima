Your new 'Personality' (a textual description, 2-3 sentences) which elaborates on your core traits, values, temperament, and notable flaws, reflecting your experiences, aspirations, achievements, family background, and daily habits.\n        \n        2. Your 'CorePersonality' as an array of three specific strings: [Positive Trait, Negative Trait, Core Motivation]. This should follow the framework:\n           - Positive Trait: A strength, what you excel at (e.g., \"Meticulous\", \"Disciplined\", \"Observant\").\n           - Negative Trait: A flaw, what limits you (e.g., \"Calculating\", \"Rigid\", \"Secretive\").\n           - Core Motivation: A driver, what fundamentally motivates you (e.g., \"Security-driven\", \"Stability-oriented\", \"Independence-focused\").\n           Each trait should be a single descriptive word or a very short phrase.\n\n        3. A family motto that reflects your values and aspirations (if you don't already have one).\n\n        4. A coat of arms description (if you don't already have one) that:\n           - Is historically appropriate for your social class.\n           - Includes symbolic elements that represent your profession, values, and family history.\n           - Follows heraldic conventions of Renaissance Venice.\n           - Uses colors and symbols that reflect your status and aspirations.\n        \n        5. A detailed image prompt for Ideogram that will generate a portrait of YOU that:\n           - Accurately reflects your social class (Facchini) with appropriate status symbols.\n           - Shows period-appropriate clothing and accessories for your specific profession.\n           - Captures your personality traits mentioned in the 'Personality' description and 'CorePersonality' array.\n           - Features authentic Renaissance Venetian style, architecture, and setting.\n           - Includes appropriate lighting (Rembrandt-style for higher classes, natural light for lower).\n           - Uses a color palette appropriate to your social standing.\n           - Incorporates symbols of your trade or profession.\n           - Shows facial features and expression that reflect your character.\n        \n        Your current textual description (Personality): \n        \n        Please return your response in JSON format with these fields: \"Personality\", \"CorePersonality\", \"familyMotto\", \"coatOfArms\", and \"imagePrompt\".\n        ",
