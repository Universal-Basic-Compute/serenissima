These waters have been good to me for twenty years now. *Marco adjusts his red cap as he gestures toward the bustling Venetian harbor* \n\nI'm Marco Ragusa, captain of this galley. I notice you're new to our Republic - the name's NTK, yes? A Popolani by your colors. *He studies you with weathered but shrewd eyes* \n\nWhat brings you to Venice? Trade opportunities are plentiful these days, especially for those with the right connections. I've built quite the network moving goods through these waters.
