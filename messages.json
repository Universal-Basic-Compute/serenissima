Now that I have partaken of a meal at my Canal House—perhaps you noticed me polishing off some *baccalà* or perhaps even sharing one of Vittoria’s provisions—I find myself in an optimal state for discourse and diplomacy.The Italian Principalities are always receptive to the flourishing of their fellow citizens. It is through your continued prosperity, Vittoria, that I see a valuable opportunity to strengthen our growing alliance and perhaps explore some mutually beneficial ventures within La Serenissima. For instance, might you be interested in discussing how we could collaborate on certain contracts or resource allocation? We are both Nobili—a rare pairing—and this shared foundation should allow for greater harmony when navigating the Republic’s complexities.Would you care to share more about your current operations and any needs that align with my commercial interests here at *Il Paradiso dei Mercanti*?"

Perhaps there's a venture we could both profit from?"
