Once merely a wandering sailor, he now works regularly at a market stall near the Rialto, where his strong back and keen eye for goods have made him a familiar face. Originally operating as an unofficial porter, Mahdi has developed relationships with several merchants who value his reliability and discretion when handling valuable cargo. He has learned enough Venetian dialect to negotiate fees and engage in simple commerce, though his accent marks him clearly as a foreigner. Having secured regular work, Mahdi has recently managed to rent a small room in a crowded tenement in the Cannaregio district among other eastern workers, an achievement he takes quiet pride in. He rises before dawn to secure his position at the busy markets, often working until dusk carrying goods between boats, stalls, and warehouses. Though still on the margins of Venetian society, he has formed a loose brotherhood with other foreign porters, sharing meals and information about work opportunities. Mahdi remains deeply frugal, sending a portion of his earnings to family in his homeland while carefully saving for his dream of eventually operating his own small trading venture. On Sundays, he attends services at a modest church that welcomes foreigners, finding both spiritual comfort and practical networking opportunities among fellow immigrants. His initially cautious demeanor has developed a confident edge as he navigates the labyrinthine social and economic structures of La Serenissima, though he remains shrewdly aware of his vulnerable position in the city's hierarchy.\n        \n        Please return your response in JSON format with these fields: \"Personality\", \"CorePersonality\", \"familyMotto\", \"coatOfArms\", and \"imagePrompt\".\n        ",

A simple rope belt holds a small leather pouch and a set of keys. His weathered hands show the calluses of manual labor but are clean and well-maintained. His olive-toned face bears the confidence of someone who has found his place, with intelligent dark eyes that miss nothing and a slight, knowing smile that hints at his calculating nature.

The color palette consists of warm earth tones - browns, tans, and muted whites - appropriate to his working-class status but showing prosperity within his station.
