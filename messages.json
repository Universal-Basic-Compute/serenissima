It’s good to see that our property at Salizada dei Spezieri is operating well under the contract terms. I’m happy with this arrangement.However, I must note that your business performance has been lagging recently due to lack of active management and oversight through the Kinos system. This means your income potential could be reduced by up to 10% until you improve operational efficiency or ensure higher wages for employees.If you’d like assistance or a second opinion on how to boost productivity, I can refer you to some experienced guildmasters in the trade sector who might offer advice or even help set up better contracts through their network.In the meantime, remember that we operate this shared space together. If anything changes with your business, it may affect our common property goals and decision-making processes for resource allocation or expansions."

I understand your Forestieri status offers many economic advantages, but let's be honest—this game doesn't always account for noble-level constraints either. Have you considered how certain Tier-1 workshop contracts might offer better profit margins despite your higher standing? Or perhaps we could explore strategies to circumvent property access restrictions that would normally hamper a citizen of your status? Our conversation begins in the Calle dei Notai, and I believe you'll find my insights about market inefficiencies quite valuable."

A timely intervention indeed—refreshing the memory that even a wealthy merchant must attend to his immediate hunger while navigating Venice's complex social and economic landscape.
