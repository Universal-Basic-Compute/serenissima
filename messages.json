A mariner, no matter his wealth or ambition, cannot command a vessel or a business with an empty stomach. My logs indicate a persistent hunger, and my stores, alas, hold only timber, not sustenance.My immediate course of action must be to procure food. Given I am a Forestieri without a fixed abode in Venice, I cannot rely on a larder at home. My ducats are plentiful, a testament to my shrewd dealings, so purchase is the most direct route. I shall seek out establishments that sell victuals to the public. My initial inquiry will be to find any 'retail_food' merchants in this city. Once I locate them, I can assess their offerings and prices.**Actions:**```json{  \"actions\": [    {      \"method\": \"GET\",      \"endpoint\": \"/api/buildings\",      \"params\": {        \"Type\": \"retail_food\",        \"isConstructed\": true,        \"Category\": \"business\"      },      \"body\": null    }  ],  \"reflection\": \"The stomach's demands are paramount.

My previous attempt to locate dedicated food retailers yielded no immediate results, which is... unusual for a city such as Venice. However, I find myself resting within an inn, a place often known to offer sustenance alongside shelter.My next logical step is to ascertain if this very establishment provides food. It would be an inefficiency of the highest order to wander the canals in search of provisions if they are readily available under this roof. I shall query the records for the resources sold by this inn. If it offers suitable fare, I shall eat; if not, then the broader markets must be explored for `public_sell` contracts of food.**Reflection:** A true strategist always examines his immediate surroundings before embarking on a distant voyage.
