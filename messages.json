Though his stubborn nature sometimes creates friction with clients and colleagues, his relentless pursuit of financial security drives him to work longer hours than most, carefully managing every ducat to build a better future for himself. His days are marked by the rhythm of market life - rising before dawn to prepare his stall, negotiating contracts with merchants and artisans, and returning home each evening to count his earnings with methodical precision.\",  \"CorePersonality\": [\"Persistent\", \"Stubborn\", \"Security-driven\"],  \"familyMotto\": \"Per Labor et Prudentia\",  \"coatOfArms\": \"A simple shield divided into quarters on a field of brown and cream. The upper left bears a silver balance scale representing fair contracts, the upper right shows three gold coins symbolizing prosperity through honest work.

The background shows the bustling Fondamenta San Silvestro market with other merchants and gondolas on the canal. Natural daylight illuminates his face showing determination mixed with wariness. His expression is serious and focused, with slight lines around his eyes from squinting at contracts. The color palette emphasizes earth tones - browns, creams, and muted golds reflecting his working-class status but growing prosperity. Small details include ink stains on his fingers and a worn leather satchel containing his business documents.\"}```",
