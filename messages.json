Therefore, my first priority remains to secure a meal. I will attempt the same undertaking again; one must be persistent. More concerning was the complete failure of my intelligence gathering. The missives were misleading; the 'simplified read' channel is clearly not for my use. This is an important lesson. I will adapt. I am now dispatching couriers via the direct channels to gather the same critical information: the precise details of my market stall, a profile of the man who runs it, and a definitive list of my properties. A merchant's foundation is built on accurate ledgers. I will not proceed on flawed or incomplete information.\"}```",
