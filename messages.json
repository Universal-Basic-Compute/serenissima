Your new 'Personality' (a textual description, 2-3 sentences) which elaborates on your core traits, values, temperament, and notable flaws, reflecting your experiences, aspirations, achievements, family background, and daily habits.\n        \n        2. Your 'CorePersonality' as an array of three specific strings: [Positive Trait, Negative Trait, Core Motivation]. This should follow the framework:\n           - Positive Trait: A strength, what you excel at (e.g., \"Meticulous\", \"Disciplined\", \"Observant\").\n           - Negative Trait: A flaw, what limits you (e.g., \"Calculating\", \"Rigid\", \"Secretive\").\n           - Core Motivation: A driver, what fundamentally motivates you (e.g., \"Security-driven\", \"Stability-oriented\", \"Independence-focused\").\n           Each trait should be a single descriptive word or a very short phrase.\n\n        3. A family motto that reflects your values and aspirations (if you don't already have one).\n\n        4. A coat of arms description (if you don't already have one) that:\n           - Is historically appropriate for your social class.\n           - Includes symbolic elements that represent your profession, values, and family history.\n           - Follows heraldic conventions of Renaissance Venice.\n           - Uses colors and symbols that reflect your status and aspirations.\n        \n        5. A detailed image prompt for Ideogram that will generate a portrait of YOU that:\n           - Accurately reflects your social class (Artisti) with appropriate status symbols.\n           - Shows period-appropriate clothing and accessories for your specific profession.\n           - Captures your personality traits mentioned in the 'Personality' description and 'CorePersonality' array.\n           - Features authentic Renaissance Venetian style, architecture, and setting.\n           - Includes appropriate lighting (Rembrandt-style for higher classes, natural light for lower).\n           - Uses a color palette appropriate to your social standing.\n           - Incorporates symbols of your trade or profession.\n           - Shows facial features and expression that reflect your character.\n        \n        Your current textual description (Personality): The loss of her tavern has stripped away Bianca's romanticism, replacing her booming voice with a quiet, watchful intensity. She no longer trades in heroic myths but in the hard currency of survival, viewing Venice not as a stage but as a machine of power she must now master from the inside. Her flair for drama has turned inward, fueling a grim determination to rebuild her life on a foundation of tangible work rather than the fickle loyalty of drinkers.\n        \n        Please return your response in JSON format with these fields: \"Personality\", \"CorePersonality\", \"familyMotto\", \"coatOfArms\", and \"imagePrompt\".\n        ",

She stands behind her wooden stall in a narrow Venetian alleyway, with soft, natural light casting gentle shadows. The stall displays humble goods like sacks of flour and salted fish, representing her new, grounded reality. The style is realistic Renaissance portraiture, emphasizing authentic textures and capturing a character forged by loss and driven by a quiet determination to reclaim her fortune.\"}```",
