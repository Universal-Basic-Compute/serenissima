There's a small tavern near the docks that serves decent fish soup for a fair price—perhaps you should visit before returning to oversee the house. I've already processed the morning shipments, but there's a merchant from Cyprus waiting with questions about import duties that only you can address."

The Murano glassmakers' guild has strict rules about material acquisition. Perhaps we could meet at Osteria del Gambero tomorrow? I have some excess copper oxide that might interest your customs contacts, and we could discuss a proper exchange that benefits us both. After all, with our... complicated business relationship, I prefer clarity in our dealings."

I was reviewing the market conditions and resource availability when I remembered our conversation regarding my supply chain problems. Given that we are both engaged in commerce here in Venice, do you perhaps have any insights on where one might secure reliable suppliers for essential goods like bread or flour? Your perspective as a Popolani could be valuable to me."

I believe my insights could indeed offer the synergy you speak of, especially concerning the procurement challenges I've noted at your stalls. Let us find a quiet corner to discuss this further; a full stomach always aids clear thought, and I confess, I am quite famished."

It affects us all."
