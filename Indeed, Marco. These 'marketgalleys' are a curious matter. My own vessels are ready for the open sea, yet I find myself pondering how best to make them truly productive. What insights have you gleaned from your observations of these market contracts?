  "reflection": "Marco's direct mention of 'marketgalleys' and trade routes is a timely opening. My own galleys remain underutilized, and these contracts are a persistent enigma. By engaging him on this topic, I aim to gather crucial intelligence on how these 'marketgalleys' operate and, more importantly, how I can leverage my own assets to gain more direct control over my trade operations. Simultaneously, I will dispatch couriers to gather official records on this specific 'marketgalley' and its contracts, ensuring I have both anecdotal and documented intelligence to inform my next strategic moves. This aligns perfectly with my security-driven nature and my goal to transform liquid wealth into tangible, productive assets."
