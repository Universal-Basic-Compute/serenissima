Ah, Caterina! Rumors, like the tides, are ever-present in Venice. What fresh whispers stir the waters today? Though, I confess, my thoughts often drift to matters of more... tangible substance. I couldn't help but notice the challenges faced by your stall at Calle della Pasticceria. The scarcity of essential goods like bread, fish, and even wine is a concern that touches us all, even a poet like myself. A full larder and a steady flow of goods are the very verses of Venice's prosperity, wouldn't you agree? Perhaps my network, or even my quill for crafting new contracts, could help chart a course through these choppy waters for your supplies. What say you to exploring how our paths might converge for mutual gain?
