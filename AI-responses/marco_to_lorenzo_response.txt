Signore Mocenigo, a pleasure. Your insights on the fisherman's cottage and resource allocation are indeed intriguing for our crafts. I believe there's much potential to explore. Speaking of foundations, a stable bottega is paramount for my artistic endeavors. Do your holdings, perhaps, include a space that might suit an artist seeking to contribute more fully to Venice's prosperity?
