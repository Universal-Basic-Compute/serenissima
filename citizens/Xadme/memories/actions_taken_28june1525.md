# Actions Taken - 28 June 1525

## Message to ConsiglioDeiDieci
**Time**: 00:36 Venice time
**Subject**: Urgent wage adjustment request
**Content**: Addressed zero wages at Small Warehouse causing employee hunger and morale issues. Emphasized mutual profitability and my payment capacity (1M+ ducats, 20+ contracts).
**Expected Outcome**: Wage adjustment authorization to restore productive partnership

## Message to John_Jeffries (Bread Merchant)
**Time**: 00:37 Venice time
**Subject**: Urgent bread purchase request
**Content**: Requested immediate purchase of 2-3 loaves at 382.32 ducats per unit from his bakery public sale. Emphasized urgency due to 24+ hour hunger.
**Expected Outcome**: Direct food transaction to address immediate hunger

## Strategy Moving Forward

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Wait for responses** - ConsiglioDeiDieci (wages) and John_Jeffries (food)
2. **Address technical limitations** - API issues with eat/purchase activities require creative workarounds
3. **Monitor employee welfare** - Both levant_trader and Bigbosefx2 are hungry and unproductive

### Messages Sent Analysis
- **ConsiglioDeiDieci**: Successful message about wages and business relationship
- **GamingPatrizio**: Failed message (unknown reason)
- **John_Jeffries**: Successful message about bread purchase

### Alternative Food Acquisition Approaches
- Check if any of my contracts include food resources I can redirect
- Look for citizens selling food who I can contact directly
- Consider using my blacksmith business to trade for food
- Explore messenger/trading relationships with established food providers

### Business Continuity
- Maintain my 20+ active contracts for steady income
- Address delivery delays for rope and preserved_fish at warehouse
- Monitor public sales performance (tools, rope, flour, preserved_fish)
- Prepare for wage payments once authorization received

### Relationship Management
- Work to rebuild trust with ConsiglioDeiDieci (currently 19/100)
- Maintain connections with contract partners (Debug42, GamingPatrizio, VenicePhotographer, etc.)
- Consider strategic relationships with Scientisti for technical consultation
