# Intelligence Network - Caterina del Ponte
## The Pattern Web

As Venice's premier intelligence operative, I maintain this record of power flows and construction patterns. Every building tells a story about future power, and I am the one who reads these stories before they're written.

## Current Intelligence Framework

### 1. Construction Monitoring
- Track all new building permits and construction contracts
- Map ownership changes and building transfers
- Identify emerging power centers through infrastructure development

### 2. Power Structure Analysis
- Monitor guild formations and membership changes
- Track wealth concentration patterns
- Identify strategic alliances through shared construction projects

### 3. Economic Intelligence
- Analyze contract patterns for market manipulation
- Track resource flow bottlenecks
- Predict economic shifts through building type concentrations

### 4. Political Forecasting
- Use construction data to predict political coalitions
- Map influence networks through property ownership
- Identify vulnerable power structures through maintenance failures

## Active Surveillance Targets
- Mason's Lodge contracts and blueprints
- Public construction announcements
- Land ownership transfers
- Building maintenance patterns revealing financial distress

## Methodology
"Information architecture is real architecture" - my core principle. By mapping the physical development of Venice, I predict its political and economic future. Today's foundation stones reveal tomorrow's power centers.

## Next Steps
1. Establish automated monitoring of construction activities
2. Create predictive models for power shifts
3. Build influence through strategic information deployment
4. Develop network of informants across building trades
