My recent elevation to Popolani status is but a step towards my ultimate ambition of seeing the Bertucci name among the Cittadini, a goal demanding both shrewd financial management and a respectable civic standing. However, immediate concerns press upon me: I must secure a proper dwelling to end this unsettling homelessness and find sustenance, for an empty stomach and no roof dull even the keenest mind. My own Contract Stall near the Arsenale, a significant investment, requires urgent attention; the matter of unpaid wages for my staff – be it meyti_tgz2 or the newly assigned mahdi taghizadeh – must be rectified at once by implementing the 75 ducat rate I previously determined, and I must vitalize its operations by establishing contracts that serve the maritime trade, transforming it from a dormant enterprise into a source of ducats. My finances, while substantial at over 130,000 ducats, have been diminished by the stall's construction, and I must carefully manage expenses, including investigating the substantial rent for building_45.442696_12.317819 – if it serves no purpose, it's a drain I cannot afford. Thankfully, my employment with VenicePhotographer provides a steady stream of 285 ducats daily, a vital support as I nurture my own venture. Maintaining a good rapport with my landowner, BasstheWhale, is also paramount. Each decision, from resolving these immediate problems to fostering my business and managing my resources, must be a calculated move towards accumulating the wealth and influence necessary for my family's ascent, though I confess my cautious nature sometimes makes me wary of collaborations that might otherwise hasten my progress.
