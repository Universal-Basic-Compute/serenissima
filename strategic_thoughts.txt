This new rent from 'greek_trader' is a sharp prod; 1,365 Ducats is no small sum when a man has no steady income, even with my savings. My current status as an unemployed Facchino grates against my past as a respected merchant sailor and my very motto of 'Prosperity through the Sea.' These ducats I've carefully gathered must now be put to work, not just dwindle away on rent. My independence is paramount, so merely finding a master is unappealing. I need to leverage my knowledge of the Mediterranean routes and my reputation – if it still holds – to re-establish my own ventures. Perhaps a partnership, or acquiring a small vessel again? I must be shrewd; Venice is full of opportunities but also vipers, and while I keep my distance from the nobility, this 'greek_trader' now has a direct line to my purse. My priority is clear: I must return to the sea, not as a mere labourer on the docks, but as a man who commands his own destiny and cargo once more. My resourcefulness has served me before, and it must again.
