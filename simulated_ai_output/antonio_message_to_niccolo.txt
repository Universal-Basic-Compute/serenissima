Niccol√≤, my friend, it's good to speak with you. While I appreciate your words, I am, like yourself, a Popolani, striving to build my fortune from the ground up. You speak of opportunities for our class, and indeed, I find myself with one right now: my new bakery sits idle. Do you, or perhaps someone in your network, know of a capable soul who might wish to operate it?
