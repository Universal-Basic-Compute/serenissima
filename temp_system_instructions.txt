He wears practical maritime clothing: a weather-worn blue woolen tunic, sturdy brown leather vest, loose-fitting canvas trousers, and a red kerchief. His Mediterranean complexion shows sun-weathering, with alert dark eyes that seem both friendly and calculating beneath slightly furrowed brows. His posture is confident yet guarded, one hand resting on a small crate of Greek goods, the other near a simple dagger at his belt. The afternoon sunlight casts natural illumination on his face, highlighting his determined expression. Nearby lie symbols of his trade: ropes, olive oil amphoras, and citrus fruits. His clothing shows quality but practicality befitting a successful facchini (porter/laborer) aspiring to greater status, photographed in a realistic Renaissance Venetian harbor style.", "position": {"lat": 45.442971, "lng": 12.326653}, "imageUrl": "/images/citizens/greek_trader1.jpg", "ducats": 1083652.1630365963, "description": "Antonio is a resilient Greek trader whose optimistic facade masks a calculating survivor, navigating both Venetian society and Mediterranean waters with equal vigilance.
