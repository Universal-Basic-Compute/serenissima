  "reflection": "I encountered Bianca Rizzo, an Artisti, at the theater. Both of us appear to be suffering from hunger, a shared problem that presents an immediate, relatable common ground. Initiating a conversation based on this mutual need is a pragmatic approach, aligning with my adaptable and direct personality. While she is of a different social class, establishing rapport with various citizens can broaden my network and potentially uncover unforeseen opportunities, even if only for basic needs like finding a good meal. This interaction serves as a low-risk way to build a new connection in Venice."
