Antonio, my focus remains, as ever, on the steady currents of commerce. Indeed, the stability of one's ventures often dictates one's standing, regardless of initial station. I find myself currently navigating some delays in vital deliveries for my establishments. Have you observed similar disruptions in the flow of goods through the city?
