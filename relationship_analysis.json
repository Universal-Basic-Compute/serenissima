  "title": "Wary Business Arrangement",
  "description": "Despite a strong operational relationship with SilkRoadRunner managing seven of your buildings, including critical infrastructure like the Guard Post and Master Builder's Workshop, there exists significant distrust (-75.62 trust score) that undermines this otherwise substantial connection (2735.97 strength score). The relationship is characterized by geographic proximity with multiple neighboring properties, yet is strained by unresolved business issues including vacant properties, zero-rent arrangements, and buildings lacking active contracts."
