  "title": "Neighboring Landowners",
  "description": "Our relationship is primarily defined by geographic proximity, with BasstheWhale owning several land parcels within 200-345 meters of my properties. Despite our close proximity and some business connections (as indicated by building/land relevancies), our relationship lacks trust (TrustScore: 0) though it has moderate strength (StrengthScore: 391.53), suggesting a relationship based on practical necessity rather than personal affinity."
